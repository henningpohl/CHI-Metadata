  "abstract": "E-petitioning has become one of the most important and popular forms of online activism. Although e-petition success is driven by user behavior, users have received relatively little study by HCI and social computing researchers. Drawing from theoretical and empirical work in analogous social computing systems, we identify two potentially competing theories about the trajectories of users in e-petition platforms: (1) \"power\" users in social computing systems are born, not made; and (2) users mature into \"power\" users. In a quantitative analysis of data from Change.org, one of the largest online e-petition platforms, we test and find support for both theories. A follow-up qualitative analysis shows that not only do users learn from their experience, systems also \"learn\" from users to make better recommendations. In this sense, we find that although power users are \"born,\" they are also \"made\" through both processes of personal growth and improved support from the system.",
