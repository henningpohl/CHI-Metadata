  "abstract": "This paper presents a controlled experiment assessing the accuracy when interpreting remote users showing a shared object on a large wall-sized display, either by looking at it or by looking and pointing at it. We analyze both distance and angle errors and how they are sensitive to the relative position be- tween the remote viewer and the video feed. We show that the remote user can accurately determine the target, that eye gaze alone is more accurate than combined with the hand, and that the relative position between the viewer and the video feed has little effect on accuracy. These findings can inform the design of future telepresence systems for wall-sized displays.",
