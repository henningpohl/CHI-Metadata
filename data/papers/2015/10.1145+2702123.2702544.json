  "abstract": "Recent research shows that fashion already exists in the HCI domain and influences and affects design and designers' thinking and practices throughout the design process. In this note, we draw our insights from fashion related research within HCI and interaction design, provide some observations about fashion-related design and research practices, raise questions about our field as moving forward towards fashion driven discipline.",
