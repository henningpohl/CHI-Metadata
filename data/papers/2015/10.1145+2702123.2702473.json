  "abstract": "We present an exploratory analysis of the effects of game world topologies on self-reported player experience in Computer Role Playing Games (CRPGs). We find that (a) players are more engaged in game worlds that better match their self-reported preferences; and (b) player preferences for game topology can be predicted based on their in-game behavior. We further describe how in-game behavioral features that correlate to preferences can be used to control procedural content generation algorithms.",
