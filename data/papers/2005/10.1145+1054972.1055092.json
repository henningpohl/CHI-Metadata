  "abstract": "This is a descriptive case study investigating the use of two computer-based programming environments (CPEs), MicroWorlds\u2122 Logo (MW) and Stagecast Creator\u2122 (SC) for collaborative scientific modeling. The purpose of the study was to investigate and comparatively describe student approaches to scientific modeling through the use of textual or graphical program languages (PL). I analyzed student activities and conversations in two after-school clubs, one working with MW and the other with SC, using contextual inquiry, analysis of student conversation and artifact analysis. The findings suggest that student work with CPEs differed between different PL. Students used SC to create games (focusing on the overall story) whereas MW students used MW through a frame of formal programming. Programming in SC was much easier than MW, whereas reading code in MW was more tangible. Findings suggest that differences in student approaches to scientific modeling through programming need to be considered by educators seeking to engage students in such activities and software developers seeking to develop CPEs for young learners.",
