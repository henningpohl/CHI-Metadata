  "abstract": "Messaging is a ubiquitous digital communication medium. It is also a minimal medium of communication because of its inability to convey immediate feedback, tone, facial expressions, hesitations, and pauses, or follow the train of the other person\u2019s thoughts. This paper combines quantitative and qualitative approaches for analyzing richer forms of typing indicators in messaging interfaces, such as showing text as it is typed. By assessing users\u2019 subjective workload and interpreting these findings in the context of users\u2019 experiences, we found that more expressive typing indicators were perceived as \u201crich in communication\u201d, as they helped people communicate more allowing for closer connections. These indicators also increased users\u2019 perceived co-presence. In addition, our research suggests there may be benefits of designing customized typing indicators for relationship maintenance and task-based communication.",
