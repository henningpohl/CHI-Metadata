  "abstract": "Introspection is the practice of looking inward for ongoing self-examination. It involves considering one's past experiences and asking questions about the present and future. Our work investigates how AI could open new possibilities for supporting introspective experiences. Adopting a design fiction approach, we created a fictional company called Meta.Aware to contextualize 4 different Introspective AI product concepts in the form of video sketches. We used the Meta.Aware platform to conduct interviews with 17 participants, using the 4 concept videos as prompts for discussion. Participants had a range of reactions related to perceived benefits and tensions in this emerging design space. We interpret these results to outline future design directions for mobilizing AI as a resource to support introspective experiences over time, as well as to reflect on issues and dilemmas bound to this emerging design space.",
