  "abstract": "In Community-Based Question Answering (CQA) platforms, people can participate in discussions about non-factoid topics by marking their stances, providing premises, or arguing for the opinions they support, which forms \u201ccollective arguments\u201d. The sustainable development of collective arguments relies on a big contributor base, yet most of the frequent CQA users are lurkers who seldom speak out. With a formative study, we identified detailed obstacles preventing lurkers from contributing to collective arguments. We consequently designed a processing pipeline for extracting and summarizing augmentative elements from question threads. Based on this we built CoArgue, a tool with navigation and chatbot features to support CQA lurkers\u2019 motivation and ability in making contributions. Through a within-subject study (N=24), we found that, compared to a Quora-like baseline, participants perceived CoArgue as significantly more useful in enhancing their motivation and ability to join collective arguments and found the experience to be more engaging and productive.",
