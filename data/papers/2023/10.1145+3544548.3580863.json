  "abstract": "Biases in algorithmic systems have led to discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups, including the reinforcement of outdated gender stereotypes. While a substantial body of research addresses biases in algorithms and underlying data, in this work, we study if and how users themselves reflect these biases in their interactions with systems, which expectedly leads to the further manifestation of biases. More specifically, we investigate the replication of stereotypical gender representations by users in formulating online search queries. Following prototype theory, we define the disproportionate mention of the gender that does not conform to the prototypical representative of a searched domain (e.g., \u201cmale nurse\u201d) as an indication of bias. In a pilot study with 224 US participants and a main study with 400 UK participants, we find clear evidence of gender biases in formulating search queries. We also report the effects of an educative text on user behaviour and highlight the wish of users to learn about bias-mitigating strategies in their interactions with search engines.",
