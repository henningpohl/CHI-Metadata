  "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) presents new challenges for the user experience (UX) of products and services. Recently, practitioner-facing resources and design guidelines have become available to ease some of these challenges. However, little research has investigated if and how these guidelines are used, and how they impact practice. In this paper, we investigated how industry practitioners use the People + AI Guidebook. We conducted interviews with 31 practitioners (i.e., designers, product managers) to understand how they use human-AI guidelines when designing AI-enabled products. Our findings revealed that practitioners use the guidebook not only for addressing AI\u2019s design challenges, but also for education, cross-functional communication, and for developing internal resources. We uncovered that practitioners desire more support for early phase ideation and problem formulation to avoid AI product failures. We discuss the implications for future resources aiming to help practitioners in designing AI products.",
