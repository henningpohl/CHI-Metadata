  "abstract": "This paper examines the social, technological, and emotional labor of maintaining China\u2019s data-driven governance broadly, and dynamic zero-COVID management in particular. Drawing on ethnographic research in China, we examine the sociotechnical work of maintenance during the 2022 Shanghai lockdown. This labor included coordinating mass testing, quarantine, and lockdown procedures as well as implementing ad-hoc technological workarounds and managing public sentiments. We demonstrate that, far from being effected from the top down, China\u2019s data-driven governance relies on the circumscribed participation of citizens. During Shanghai\u2019s lockdown, citizens with relevant expertise helped to maintain technological stability by fixing or programming data systems, but also to ensure the ongoing production of\u201cpositive feelings\u201d about social stability through data-driven governance. In so doing, such citizens simultaneously enacted an ambivalent and circumscribed form of agency, and maintained social and by extension political stability. This article sheds light on data-driven governance and political processes of maintenance.",
