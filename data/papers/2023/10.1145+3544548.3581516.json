  "abstract": "Programming instructors often conduct in-class exercises to help them identify students that are falling behind and surface students\u2019 misconceptions. However, as we found in interviews with programming instructors, monitoring students\u2019 progress during exercises is difficult, particularly for large classes. We present VizProg, a system that allows instructors to monitor and inspect students\u2019 coding progress in real-time during in-class exercises. VizProg represents students\u2019 statuses as a 2D Euclidean spatial map that encodes the students\u2019 problem-solving approaches and progress in real-time. VizProg allows instructors to navigate the temporal and structural evolution of students\u2019 code, understand relationships between code, and determine when to provide feedback. A comparison experiment showed that VizProg helped to identify more students\u2019 problems than a baseline system. VizProg also provides richer and more comprehensive information for identifying important student behavior. By managing students\u2019 activities at scale, this work presents a new paradigm for improving the quality of live learning.",
