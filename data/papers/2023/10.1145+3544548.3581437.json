  "abstract": "We present AeroRigUI, an actuated tangible UI for 3D spatial embodied interaction. Using strings controlled by self-propelled swarm robots with a reeling mechanism on ceiling surfaces, our approach enables rigging (control through strings) physical objects\u2019 position and orientation in the air. This can be applied to novel interactions in 3D space, including dynamic physical affordances, 3D information displays, and haptics. Utilizing the ceiling, an often underused room area, AeroRigUI can be applied for a range of applications such as room organization, data physicalization, and animated expressions. We demonstrate the applications based on our proof-of-concept prototype, which includes the hardware design of the rigging robots, named RigBots, and the software design for mid-air object control via interactive string manipulation. We also introduce technical evaluation and analysis of our approach prototype to address the hardware feasibility and safety. Overall, AeroRigUI enables a novel spatial and tangible UI system with great controllability and deployability.",
