  "abstract": "Error rates (ERs) in target-pointing tasks are typically modelled in two steps: predicting the click-point variability (\u03c3) based on target sizes and then computing the probability that a click falls outside a target. This is an indirect approach if the researcher\u2019s purpose is to achieve the accurate prediction of ERs because the model coefficients are optimized to predict \u03c3 accurately in the first step. We compared the prediction accuracies of this method with a more direct technique in which the coefficients used for \u03c3 are determined in such a way as to optimize the closeness between observed and predicted ERs. Our re-analysis of eight datasets from mouse- and touch-based pointing studies showed that the latter approach consistently outperforms the conventional one if the starting values for the parameter search are appropriate (which can be achieved by hyperparameter optimization), thus enabling the interface configuration on the basis of accurately predicted ERs.",
