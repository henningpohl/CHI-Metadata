  "abstract": "Professional sports have large fan bases that congregate in online sports fan communities. The sports community is suitable to be a sandbox for studying offline context\u2019s effects on online community behavior. By now, prior works did not present a detailed study on the offline-online connection by examining detailed community discussion content. To fill this gap, this work presents a comprehensive study of online communities\u2019 comments about football (soccer) matches, grounded in the data from Premier League teams\u2019 Reddit online communities during the 2020-2021 season. We propose a metric \u201cgap score\u201d to quantify offline events\u2019 effects by measuring the gap between fans\u2019 prematch expectations and actual match results. Using this metric, we investigated how team performance impacted comments\u2019 sentiment, discussion topics, and the pattern of comments\u2019 votes. The findings highlight the close connection that exists between offline events and online discussions and reveals both theoretical and practical implications for online communities.",
