  "abstract": "Studies of mapper conflict in OpenStreetMap (OSM) have focused exclusively on cartographic vandalism and its effect on data quality. This paper takes a broader view on mapper conflict in OSM. Using a Delphi survey method, we collect qualitative data on perceived conflict from long-time OSM mappers. We ask mappers about four aspects of conflict in OSM: (1) topic of conflict, (2) factors leading to conflict, (3) effects of conflict, and (4) potential conflict management methods. Our results show that conflict in OSM can be explained by clashing values and opinions within and across different mapper subgroups and can be exacerbated by negative mapper behaviors. The boundaries of these subgroups, while implicit, are often defined by gender, mappers\u2019 geographic location, level of expertise, and mappers\u2019 professional affiliation. Based on these results, we discuss design options for OSM\u2019s existing public communication channels that often become foci of mapper conflict management.",
