  "abstract": "The overlaying of physical spaces with digital information produces hybrid spaces, redefining people\u2019s experience of social interactions. Location-based games (LBGs) with social components are a good case. Yet, the impact LBGs have on sociability remains under-researched. In April 2020, the new in-person/remote raiding format in the LBG Pok\u00e9mon GO provided a lens to explore people\u2019s social interactions in hybrid spaces. We interviewed 41 Pok\u00e9mon GO players to understand how players coordinate and collaborate for in-person/remote raids and other social patterns. Our findings demonstrate that new social dynamics occurred: participants\u2019 social interactions highly rely on external social media groups bridging cyberspace and the physical world. In such external social media groups, spontaneously formed leadership roles and mentor-mentee relationships demonstrate autonomy among players in the hybrid space. However, we observed that the interoperability issue challenges people\u2019s experience. Overall, this work sheds light on the social interactions in LBGs as hybrid spaces.",
