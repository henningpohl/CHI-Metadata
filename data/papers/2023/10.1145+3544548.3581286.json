  "abstract": "Information access is one of the most significant challenges faced by d/Deaf signers due to a lack of sign language information. Given the challenges in machine-driven solutions, we seek to understand how d/Deaf communities can support the growth of sign language content. Based on interviews with 12 d/Deaf people in China, we found that d/Deaf videos, i.e., sign language videos created by and for d/Deaf people, can be crucial information sources and educational materials. Combining content analysis of 360 d/Deaf videos to better understand this type of video, we show how d/Deaf communities co-create information accessibility through collaboration in content creation online. We uncover two major challenges that creators need to address, e.g., difficulties in interpretation and inconsistent content qualities. We propose potential design opportunities and future research directions to support d/Deaf people\u2019s needs for sign language content through collaboration within d/Deaf communities.",
