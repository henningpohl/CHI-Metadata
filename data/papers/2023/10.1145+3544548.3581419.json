  "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed Squeez\u2019In, a technique on smartphones that enabled private authentication by holding and squeezing the phone with a unique pattern. We first explored the design space of practical squeezing gestures for authentication by analyzing the participants\u2019 self-designed gestures and squeezing behavior. Results showed that varying-length gestures with two levels of touch pressure and duration were the most natural and unambiguous. We then implemented Squeez\u2019In on an off-the-shelf capacitive sensing smartphone, and employed an SVM-GBDT model for recognizing gestures and user-specific behavioral patterns, achieving 99.3% accuracy and 0.93 F1-score when tested on 21 users. A following 14-day study validated the memorability and long-term stability of Squeez\u2019In. During usability evaluation, compared with gesture and pin code, Squeez\u2019In achieved significantly faster authentication speed and higher user preference in terms of privacy and security.",
