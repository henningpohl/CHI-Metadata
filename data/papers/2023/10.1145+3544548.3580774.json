  "abstract": "Without a nuanced understanding of users\u2019 perspectives and contexts, text messaging tools for supporting psychological wellbeing risk delivering interventions that are mismatched to users\u2019 dynamic needs. We investigated the contextual factors that influence young adults\u2019 day-to-day experiences when interacting with such tools. Through interviews and focus group discussions with 36 participants, we identified that people\u2019s daily schedules and affective states were dominant factors that shape their messaging preferences. We developed two messaging dialogues centered around these factors, which we deployed to 42 participants to test and extend our initial understanding of users\u2019 needs. Across both studies, participants provided diverse opinions of how they could be best supported by messages, particularly around when to engage users in more passive versus active ways. They also proposed ways of adjusting message length and content during periods of low mood. Our findings provide design implications and opportunities for context-aware mental health management systems.",
