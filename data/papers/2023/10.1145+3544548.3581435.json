  "abstract": "Chronic lower back pain due to improper lifting techniques poses a major workplace safety hazard. The major risk factors for improper loading posture (ILP) include overloading, and improper loading of the lumbar muscles, ligaments, and vertebrae due to repetitive mechanical stresses exerted upon them. The current intervention technology relies on the users\u2019 intent and willingness to self-correct ILP through alert-based feedback or involves wearing bulky lift assist devices to prevent ILP. We address these issues with a physiological feedback system that utilizes IMU sensors for ILP detection and Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) for automatic dynamic ILP correction for restoring ideal lifting angles for torso inclination and knee bend. In a user study involving 36 participants, our automatic approach delivered significantly faster correction and outperformed alternative feedback mechanisms (Audio and Vibro-tactile) and was perceived to be interesting, comfortable and a potential commercial product.",
