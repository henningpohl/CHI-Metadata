  "abstract": "The rich detail generated by qualitative research is essential for understanding workplace contexts and processes for organizational development. This can be a highly involved and extensive process, thus limiting the number of people who can normally be allowed to fully participate. This is especially problematic when it comes to workplace collaboration and development, as it means that a large number of voices are not considered and heard. In this paper, we provide and implement a novel semi-automated approach that enables large-scale qualitative research. This was done within the context of developing a new organizational strategy for a large and diverse multi-lingual international development organization. We included over 150 different stakeholders whilst enabling their views to be collected and analyzed in depth. This case study demonstrates how to effectively implement qualitative interview research at scale with an application to the employee voice setting, contributing the tools and means to achieve this.",
