  "abstract": "Using publicly uploaded videos of the Waymo and Tesla FSD self-driving cars, this paper documents how self-driving vehicles still struggle with some basics of road interaction. To drive safely self-driving cars need to interact in traffic with other road users. Yet traffic is a complex, long established social domain. We focus on one core element of road interaction: when road users yield for each other. Yielding \u2013 such as by slowing down for others in traffic \u2013 involves communication between different road users to decide who will \u2018go\u2019 and who will \u2018yield\u2019. Videos of the Waymo and Tesla FSD self-driving cars show how these systems fail to both yield for others, as well as failing to go when yielded to. In discussion, we explore how these \u2018problems\u2019 illustrate both the complexity of designing for road interaction, but also how the space of physical machine/human social interactions more broadly can be designed for.",
