  "abstract": "We report on a qualitative study in which 22 participants created Augmented Reality (AR) stories for outdoor cultural heritage sites. As storytelling is a crucial strategy for AR content aimed at providing meaningful experiences, the emphasis has been on what storytelling does, rather than how it is done, the end user\u2019s needs prioritized over the author\u2019s. To address this imbalance, we identify how recurring patterns in the spatial trajectories and narrative compositions of AR stories for cultural heritage sites are linked to the author\u2019s intent and creative process: While authors tend to bind story arcs tightly to confined trajectories for narrative delivery, the need for spatial exploration results in thematic content mapped loosely onto encompassing trajectories. Based on our analysis, we present design recommendations for site-specific AR storytelling tools that can support authors in delivering their intent while leveraging the placeness of cultural heritage sites as a creative resource.",
