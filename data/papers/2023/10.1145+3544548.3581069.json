  "abstract": "Remote conferencing systems are increasingly used to supplement or even replace in-person teaching. However, prevailing conferencing systems restrict the teacher\u2019s representation to a webcam live-stream, hamper the teacher\u2019s use of body-language, and result in students\u2019 decreased sense of co-presence and participation. While Virtual Reality (VR) systems may increase student engagement, the teacher may not have the time or expertise to conduct the lecture in VR. To address this issue and bridge the requirements between students and teachers, we have developed Tutor In-sight, a Mixed Reality (MR) avatar augmented into the student\u2019s workspace based on four design requirements derived from the existing literature, namely: integrated virtual with physical space, improved teacher\u2019s co-presence through avatar, direct attention with auto-generated body language, and usable workflow for teachers. Two user studies were conducted from the perspectives of students and teachers to determine the advantages of Tutor In-sight in comparison to two existing conferencing systems, Zoom (video-based) and Mozilla Hubs (VR-based). The participants of both studies favoured Tutor In-sight. Among others, this main finding indicates that Tutor In-sight satisfied the needs of both teachers and students. In addition, the participants\u2019 feedback was used to empirically determine the four main teacher requirements and the four main student requirements in order to improve the future design of MR educational tools.",
