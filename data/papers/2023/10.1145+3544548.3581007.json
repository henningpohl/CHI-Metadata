  "abstract": "Recent years have seen a proliferation of security-focused smart home devices (SSHDs). SSHDs, such as smart locks and cameras, are designed to accomplish critical tasks, such as protecting one\u2019s home and property. However, their use by and for people with disabilities (PwD) has not been broadly investigated. To explore the state of SSHD use by PwD, we collected 114,871 amazon.com reviews for popular SSHDs and created a data set of reviews pertaining to PwD. We performed a broad analysis of the reviews in this data set and found that the presence of SSHDs empowered PwD to secure their domiciles independently. Further, caregivers used SSHDs to monitor PwD, ostensibly for the latter\u2019s safety, albeit without explicit consent. Moreover, we also found that SSHDs have several drawbacks that impose various barriers of use on PwD. We analyze the significance of these findings and suggest five future research opportunities for SSHD design.",
