  "abstract": "The maker movement has garnered significant attention as democratizing design; yet, recent work has called attention to the challenges disabled people encounter in making. Although researchers have built systems to improve accessibility of maker technologies, limited studies have centered disabled people\u2019s engagement in traditional forms of making like fiber arts. We examine the practice of fabric pattern design among a community of blind weavers who create hand-woven products with sighted instructors. Grounded in seventeen interviews with blind weavers and sighted instructors, we built Simphony, an audio-tactile system that aims to support blind weavers in creating and perceiving patterns. Findings from eight design exploration sessions at the community studio reveal how blind weavers used Simphony to learn the process of pattern design and generate patterns with sighted instructors. We reflect on collaborative understanding of pattern design among blind and sighted individuals and discuss opportunities for integrating technological augmentations into traditional craftwork.",
