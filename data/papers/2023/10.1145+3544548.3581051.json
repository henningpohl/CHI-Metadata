  "abstract": "Vector illustrations are object-based, meaning they are composed of strokes that can be filtered individually through textures or animations and transformed without loss of quality. These filters are typically difficult to specify without programming prerequisites. We propose filtered.ink , a full-featured illustration application to construct and explore filters via a node graph interface with a live preview. This turns vector graphics and their filters into a form of vector hypermedia that can be shared and remixed with new users. By examining interactions that occur when crafting, remixing, and using filters for dynamic illustrations through a task-based usability study, we expose new workflow patterns and avenues of expression. The observations result in a user model supported by filtered.ink: see, want, rewant, and remix. In this model, the artist breaks away from traditional notions of illustration, taking advantage of the inherent remixability of the strokes and filters in the vector graphics format.",
