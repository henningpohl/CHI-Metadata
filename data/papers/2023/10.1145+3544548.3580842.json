  "abstract": "While there has been rapid growth in smart home research from a technical perspective\u2013 focusing on home automation, devices, software, and protocols\u2013 few review papers examine the human-centered perspective. A human-centered focus is crucial for achieving the goals of providing natural, convenient, comfortable, friendly, and safe user experiences in the smart home. To understand key innovations in human-centered smart home research, we analyzed keyword changes over time via 19,091 papers from 2000 to 2022, then selected 55 papers from high-impact venues in the last five years, and summarized them through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Our analysis revealed five research trends with unique characteristics and interdependence. Drawing on this review, we elaborate on the future of smart home design research with respect to multidisciplinary development, stakeholder involvement, and the shift of design implications.",
