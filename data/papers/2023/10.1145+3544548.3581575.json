  "abstract": "Academic advising brings numerous benefits to the mission of Higher Education Institutions. One central and challenging duty of advisors is course recommendation for term planning. This task requires both knowledge of the study programs as well as a thorough analysis of the students\u2019 unique circumstances. Limited time and a large student population make this task overwhelming. As a result, an important body of research has sought to expedite term planning via data-oriented decision-support tools. The impact of such tools on students has been extensively studied. However, the advisors\u2019 perspective remains largely unexplored. We contribute to redressing this gap by studying how a grade prediction tool shapes academic advisors\u2019 approach to course recommendation. We found that while the advisors\u2019 usual strategies tend to prevail, their recommendations largely depend on the advisee\u2019s historical performance. That said, advisors also acknowledge the limitations of grades as a measure of academic success.",
