  "abstract": "Social and cultural taboos frequently prevent meaningful conversation around gendered health and wellbeing, across the globe and to varying degrees. Safe spaces can offer potential avenues to nurture non-judgmental environments for dialogue and opportunities for learning to talk through taboos. To this end, we curated an online safe space on WhatsApp\u2014with 35 participants of Indian origin\u2014to facilitate conversations around diverse topics related to gendered health and wellbeing. We observed participant activity for two weeks, before conducting in-depth interviews with 10 participants to better understand their experiences of engaging within the WhatsApp group. We use the lens of Legitimate Peripheral Participation to examine how peripheral and core members of the community drew on new audiences and support systems as they questioned existing structures upholding taboos. We discuss scaffolding mechanisms that could enhance learning about taboo topics in online safe spaces, and the tensions of anonymity in such learning spaces.",
