  "abstract": "We propose HandAvatar to enable users to embody non-humanoid avatars using their hands. HandAvatar leverages the high dexterity and coordination of users\u2019 hands to control virtual avatars, enabled through our novel approach for automatically-generated joint-to-joint mappings. We contribute an observation study to understand users\u2019 preferences on hand-to-avatar mappings on eight avatars. Leveraging insights from the study, we present an automated approach that generates mappings between users\u2019 hands and arbitrary virtual avatars by jointly optimizing control precision, structural similarity, and comfort. We evaluated HandAvatar on static posing, dynamic animation, and creative exploration tasks. Results indicate that HandAvatar enables more precise control, requires less physical effort, and brings comparable embodiment compared to a state-of-the-art body-to-avatar control method. We demonstrate HandAvatar\u2019s potential with applications including non-humanoid avatar based social interaction in VR, 3D animation composition, and VR scene design with physical proxies. We believe that HandAvatar unlocks new interaction opportunities, especially for usage in Virtual Reality, by letting users become the avatar in applications including virtual social interaction, animation, gaming, or education.",
