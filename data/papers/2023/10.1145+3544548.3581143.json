  "abstract": "Herein, we present two studies on how students\u2019 Psychological State of Decision difficulty (PSD) relates to two aspects of learning, i.e., guessing behavior and learning achievement. To measure PSD, we extracted geometric features from trajectories of drag-and-drop touch interactions collected while students aged 7\u201310 played a math game on a tablet device. In the first study, we explored whether eight geometric features extracted from 97,303 trial trajectories could be grouped to understand students\u2019 PSD. In the second study, we examined whether the two aspects of learning could be predicted using the data collected from 187 students with geometric features indicating their PSD. This work provides empirical evidence that geometric features can be grouped into two types of PSD in the context of learning, including conflict and uncertainty. Moreover, our results demonstrate that data on students\u2019 PSD collected from drag-and-drop trajectories can be used to predict learning.",
