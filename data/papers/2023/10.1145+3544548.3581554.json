  "abstract": "Personal health tracking has long been a topic of investigation in the HCI community. There is an emerging class of apps that support gender transition, which we term transition-tracking apps. However, little work has been done examining the use and impact of such apps. We aimed to address this gap by conducting an interview study with sixteen participants who are currently undergoing different forms of gender transition. We provide an understanding of transition tracking habits, the usage and potential of transition-tracking apps in the context of transition support technologies, and provide design suggestions and open areas of research.",
