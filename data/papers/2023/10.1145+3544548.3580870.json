  "abstract": "Scrolling in extended reality (XR) is currently performed using handheld controllers or vision-based arm-in-front gestures, which have the limitations of encumbering the user\u2019s hands or requiring a specific arm posture, respectively. To address these limitations, we investigate freehand, posture-independent scrolling driven by wrist deflection. We propose two novel techniques: Wrist Joystick, which uses rate control, and Wrist Drag, which uses position control. In an empirical study of a rapid item acquisition task and a casual browsing task, both Wrist Drag and Wrist Joystick performed on par with a comparable state-of-the-art technique on one of the two tasks. Further, using a relaxed arm-at-side posture, participants retained their arm-in-front performance for both wrist techniques. Finally, we analyze behavioral and ergonomic data to provide design insights for wrist deflection scrolling. Our results demonstrate that wrist deflection provides a promising method for performant scrolling controls while offering additional benefits over existing XR interaction techniques.",
