  "abstract": "We present the insights from participatory design work that explores notions of Diversity Computing (DivComp) and how HCI can meaningfully engage with designing technology around diversity without resorting to tokenistic approaches. A future goal overarching the initial findings in this paper is to design technologically mediated, physical spaces (DivComp Spaces) within a school context where children meet, experiment and learn the complex dynamics of othering. We report on a series of nine workshops with 48 children. Based on a thematic analysis, we present four themes \u2014 Technology as Utility and Authority, Individual and Collective Place-Making, Staged and Emerging Conflicts, Belonging to the Group and Self-Expression \u2014 which we use to inform three design directions for developing DivComp Spaces specifically in the context of school. Finally, we critically reflect on our design practice and the difficulties of designing not only for, but also with diversity meaningfully embedded into design processes.",
