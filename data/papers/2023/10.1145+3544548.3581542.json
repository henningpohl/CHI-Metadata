  "abstract": "With the increasing dominance of internet as a source of news consumption, there has been a rise in the production and popularity of email newsletters compiled by individual journalists. However, there is little research on the processes of aggregation, and how these differ between expert journalists and trained machines. In this paper, we interviewed journalists who curate newsletters from around the world. Through an in-depth understanding of journalists\u2019 workflows, our findings lay out the role of their prior experience in the value they bring into the curation process, their own use of algorithms in finding stories for their newsletter, and their internalization of their readers\u2019 interests and the context they are curating for. While identifying the role of human expertise, we highlight the importance of hybrid curation and provide design insights on how technology can support the work of these experts.",
