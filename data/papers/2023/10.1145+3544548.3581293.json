  "abstract": "Multiplayer digital games can use aim assistance to help people with different levels of aiming ability to play together.  To dynamically provide each player with the right amount of assistance, an aim assistance algorithm needs a model of the player\u2019s ability that can be measured and updated during gameplay. The model must be based on difficulty parameters such as target speed, size, and duration, that can be adjusted in-game to change aiming difficulty, and must account for player\u2019s spatial and temporal aiming abilities.  To satisfy these requirements, we present the novel dynamic spatiotemporal model of a player\u2019s aiming ability, based on difficulty parameters that can be manipulated in a game. In a crowdsourced experiment with 72 participants, the model was found to accurately predict how close to a target a player can aim and to converge rapidly with a small set of observations of aiming tasks.",
