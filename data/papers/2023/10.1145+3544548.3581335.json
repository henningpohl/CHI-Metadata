  "abstract": "We compare the performance and level of distraction of expressive directional gesture input in the context of in-vehicle system commands. Center console touchscreen swipes and midair swipe-like movements are tested in 8-directions, with 8-button touchscreen tapping as a baseline. Participants use these input methods for intermittent target selections while performing the Lane Change Task in a virtual driving simulator. Input performance is measured with time and accuracy, cognitive load with deviation of lane position and speed, and distraction from frequency of off-screen glances. Results show midair gestures were less distracting and faster, but with lower accuracy. Touchscreen swipes and touchscreen tapping are comparable across measures. Our work provides empirical evidence for vehicle interface designers and manufacturers considering midair or touch directional gestures for centre console input.",
