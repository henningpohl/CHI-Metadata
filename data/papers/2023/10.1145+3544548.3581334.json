  "abstract": "Digital fabrication in industrial contexts involves standardized procedures that prioritize precision and repeatability. However, fabrication machines are now available for practitioners who focus instead on experimentation. In this paper, we reframe hobbyist CNC milling as writing literate programs which interleave documentation, interactive graphics, and source code for machine control. To test this approach, we present Imprimer, a machine infrastructure for a CNC mill and an associated library for a computational notebook. Imprimer lets makers learn experimentally, prototype new interactions for making, and understand physical processes by writing and debugging code. We demonstrate three experimental milling workflows as computational notebooks, conduct a user study with practitioners with a range of backgrounds, and discuss literate programming as a future vision for digital fabrication altogether.",
