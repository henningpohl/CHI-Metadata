  "abstract": "Although menu selection has been extensively studied in HCI, most existing studies have focused on sighted users, leaving blind users\u2019 menu selection under-studied. In this paper, we propose a computational model that can simulate blind users\u2019 menu selection performance and strategies, including the way they use techniques like swiping, gliding, and direct touch. We assume that selection behavior emerges as an adaptation to the user\u2019s memory of item positions based on experience and feedback from the screen reader. A key aspect of our model is a model of long-term memory, predicting how a user recalls and forgets item position based on previous menu selections. We compare simulation results predicted by our model against data obtained in an empirical study with ten blind users. The model correctly simulated the effect of the menu length and menu arrangement on selection time, the action composition, and the menu selection strategy of the users.",
