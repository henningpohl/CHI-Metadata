  "abstract": "Urban environmental monitoring campaigns depend on expertise from city agencies, residents, and researchers. Deployment efforts rarely include all three stakeholders, typically leading to initiatives that struggle to produce credible, actionable data. We describe the implementation of a large-scale, long-term air quality sensing network in Chicago\u00a0 Illinois; detail stakeholder interviews and meetings; and present three interfaces\u2014\u2013a website accessible via in-situ QR codes, APIs, and a mobile, mixed-media experience. We show how a collaborative approach created a more equitable sensor distribution compared to crowdsourced or regulatory designs. We highlight shared goals of education, engagement, and empowerment despite the diversity of tool and analytics needs across stakeholder groups. Reflecting on our work, we develop a \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d framework representing the criticality of balanced participation from three key stakeholder groups\u2014city, community, and research\u2014in deploying novel urban technologies. This approach can help HCI researchers facilitate more democratic technology deployments in urban spaces.",
