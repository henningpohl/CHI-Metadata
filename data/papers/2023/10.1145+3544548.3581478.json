  "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in reproductive health and intimate wellbeing in Human-Computer Interaction, increasingly from an ecological perspective. Much of this work is centered around women\u2019s experiences across diverse settings, emphasizing men\u2019s limited engagement and need for greater participation on these topics. Our research responds to this gap by investigating cisgender men\u2019s experiences of cultivating sexual health literacies in an urban Indian context. We leverage media probes to stimulate focus group discussions, using popular media references on men\u2019s fertility to elicit shared reflection. Our findings uncover the role that humor and masculinity play in shaping men\u2019s perceptions of their sexual health and how this influences their sense of agency and participation in heterosexual intimate relationships. We further discuss how technologies might be designed to support men\u2019s participation in these relationships as supportive partners and allies.",
