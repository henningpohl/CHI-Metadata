  "abstract": "We are a mother and son who have been using a pair of simple, self-build communication devices to maintain a feeling of connection while separated by over 5,000 miles. The devices, called Light Touch, only allow us to send one another slowly-fading, coloured lights, yet we have been surprised by how much our ongoing interaction with them means to us. This paper contributes an autoethnographical account of our experiences over the last two years, including our initial experiences with the devices, and focusing on various aspects of our day-to-day use. Based on our observations, we discuss the features that have proven important in mediating our feelings of connection. We point out, however, that their success is contingent on our context of use and the nature of our bond, and suggest that simple systems like Light Touch may support emotional communication, but only if they are well-matched to settings and relationships.",
