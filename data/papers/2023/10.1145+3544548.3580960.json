  "abstract": "The current study is designed to replicate and validate the video game demand scale (VGDS) as a metric for understanding player experiences in video games, while also expanding the application space of that scale to an underrepresented population. Using available materials from prior VGDS research, we created the Video Game Demand Scale-Turkish (VGDS-T). The translated metric was administered online to a volunteer sample of self-identified Turkish-speaking gamers (N = 184), where participants answered questions about perceived cognitive, emotional, exertional, controller, and social demands of their most recent game, as well as other game evaluations (as validation checks). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the translated five-factor scale was a strong fit to the original 26-item scale (VGDS-English) with nominally stronger fit for a 22-item scale (VGDS-Mandarin). Therefore, we both validated the five-factor VGDS on a novel population and provided a translated the metric for researcher and industry use with Turkish-speaking gamers.",
