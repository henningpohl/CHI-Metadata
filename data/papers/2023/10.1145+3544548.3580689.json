  "abstract": "Time-killing on smartphones has become a pervasive activity, and could be opportune for delivering content to their users. This research is believed to be the first attempt at time-killing detection, which leverages the fusion of phone-sensor and screenshot data. We collected nearly one million user-annotated screenshots from 36 Android users. Using this dataset, we built a deep-learning fusion model, which achieved a precision of 0.83 and an AUROC of 0.72. We further employed a two-stage clustering approach to separate users into four groups according to the patterns of their phone-usage behaviors, and then built a fusion model for each group. The performance of the four models, though diverse, yielded better average precision of 0.87 and AUROC of 0.76, and was superior to that of the general/unified model shared among all users. We investigated and discussed the features of the four time-killing behavior clusters that explain why the models\u2019 performance differ.",
