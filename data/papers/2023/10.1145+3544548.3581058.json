  "abstract": "In AI-assisted decision-making, it is critical for human decision-makers to know when to trust AI and when to trust themselves. However, prior studies calibrated human trust only based on AI confidence indicating AI\u2019s correctness likelihood (CL) but ignored humans\u2019 CL, hindering optimal team decision-making. To mitigate this gap, we proposed to promote humans\u2019 appropriate trust based on the CL of both sides at a task-instance level. We first modeled humans\u2019 CL by approximating their decision-making models and computing their potential performance in similar instances. We demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our model via two preliminary studies. Then, we proposed three CL exploitation strategies to calibrate users\u2019 trust explicitly/implicitly in the AI-assisted decision-making process. Results from a between-subjects experiment (N=293) showed that our CL exploitation strategies promoted more appropriate human trust in AI, compared with only using AI confidence. We further provided practical implications for more human-compatible AI-assisted decision-making.",
