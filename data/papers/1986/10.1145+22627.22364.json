  "abstract": "New users of four computer-mediated communication systems were asked to indicate which of a variety of learning modes they had used, including reading written manuals, using online automated help facilities, personal or group lessons from a human teacher, and trial-and-error learning. Despite often elaborate documentation and online help, the most frequent mode actually selected by users is trial and error learning. Rather than bemoaning the fact that users do not make proper use of written documentation, the implication for system implementation is that it should be designed to effectively encourage and support trial-and-error learning. An experimental intervention offering a guided learning activity supports this conclusion.",
