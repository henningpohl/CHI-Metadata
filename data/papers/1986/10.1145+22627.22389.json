  "abstract": "To meet the challenge of constructing interfaces for increasingly complex multifunctional products, designers will be attracted by the promise offered by \u201cintelligent\u201d systems. However, the value of such sophisticated systems must be measured in terms of the quality of their user's models. One such intelligent interface \u2014 an Expert Help System \u2014 has been designed, implemented, and evaluated. We argue that the operability problems noted in users' interactions with this system are attributable to lack of a strong user model in the system interface. Such a model plays a critical role in determining the effectiveness of the system's ability to monitor the user's planning activities. We discuss the requirements of a strong user model and provide an example of how such a model might be integrated into a planner-based intelligent interface.",
