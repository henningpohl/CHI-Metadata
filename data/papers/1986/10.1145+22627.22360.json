  "abstract": "At a time when more and different people are using more and different computer systems, there is growing awareness that if technology is to give companies the \u201ccompetitive edge\u201d they are seeking, it must be used to support business goals. This means that systems must work within the existing organization to improve and extend its functioning. This also means that the design of these systems must enhance the organization, not disrupt it. Yet technology is, by its very nature, a stimulus for change. The question then becomes: How can this intrinsically de-stabilizing technology be designed and implemented in a way which supports the organization, without destroying it? It is the purpose of this panel to explore this basic question.\nSociotechnical systems theory is a method to deal with this dilemma. At its core is the assumption that to be successful, technology must be designed in tandem with the receiving organization. So-called socio-tech focuses on how the organization can use technology, in an attempt to establish a \u201cbest fit\u201d between the technical and the social aspects of the workplace. This is in contrast both to \u201cold style\u201d systems design, which concentrates on technical aspects only and to the \u201ctraditional\u201d Human Factors approach, which considers how to design for \u201ctypical\u201d users and how they think and perceive. (Some people have dubbed this new approach \u201cMacroergonomics\u201d as a way of distinguishing it from this more traditional Human Factors approach.)",
