  "abstract": "Skills developed by software user interface designers to solve problems in communication, management, implementation, and other areas may influence design decisions in the absence of sufficient knowledge of user populations. Given today's rapid change in both \u201cfaces\u201d to the software interface \u2014 user populations and software functionality \u2014 the first pass at a design may be made without sufficient understanding of the relevant goals and behaviors of the eventual users. Without this information, designers are less able to grasp \u201cuser logic\u201d, and may rely on more familiar \u201clogics\u201d that are useful in other problem-solving arenas. Understanding how these approaches can affect a design may help us recognize them across a wide range of contexts and enable us to focus the human factors contribution to the design evolution process.",
