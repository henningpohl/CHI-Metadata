  "abstract": "In a field study of use of integrated business software by business professionals, we found several characteristics of the real-world situation leading to the under-utilization of integrated software and being of importance for its human factors. Professionals work in a heterogeneous software environment filled with practical problems, they follow \u201csatisficing\u201d strategies of sub-optimal usage, and they have problems migrating to more advanced uses. Current levels of software integration do not always adequately or easily support the \u201ctask integration\u201d requirements of real tasks such as handling many small things.",
