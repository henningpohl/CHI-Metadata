  "abstract": "Workstations require use of the hands both for text entry and for cursor-positioning or menu-selection. The physical arrangement does not allow these two tasks to be done concurrently. To remove this restriction, various alternative input devices have been investigated. This work focuses on the class of foot-operated computer input devices, called moles here. Appropriate topologies for foot movement are identified, and several designs for realising them are discussed.",

The situation was that there was an alphanumeric display that had text windows and let the user point to things with a mouse, and there was a storage tube graphics display for a drawing subsystem in NLS that let {one} point at things in creating and editing pictures made up of lines, circles, rectangles, arrowheads, etc. The foot pedal was (and is) used to decide if {the user} was pointing to the text display or the graphics display. The graphics could be associated with the text. One could point to a text statement and give a command to display the picture asssociated with that text statement, then push the foot pedal to select which window on the graphics screen the pictureshoutd appearin .. \"",
