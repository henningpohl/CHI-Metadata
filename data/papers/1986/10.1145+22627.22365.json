  "abstract": "Computer-based voice messaging systems are used to send and receive confidential messages via touch-tone telephones. Auditory prompts guide users through a series of menus, listing options as users proceed through their sessions. This report describes how a voice messaging system was enhanced and redesigned based on thinking aloud protocols, customer site interviews, and usage statistics that described summary patterns of behavior. The goal of the human factors effort was to optimize system use. The evaluation of the length, wording and phrasing of auditory prompts as well as ease-of-accessibility provided by the menu structure led to specific enhancements and redesign. Feedback also helped define an audio HELP/OTHER OPTIONS system that (1) provided context sensitive assistance and (2) documented infrequently used options that enabled streamlining of routine transactions.",
