  "abstract": "Users of a windowing system were studied for the purpose of creating an empirically based windowing benchmark. Each filled out a paper questionnaire that sampled subjective opinions of windowing commands, and were observed for approximately 22 minutes while performing typical daily activities on the computer. Subjects were also asked to demonstrate a typical log-on procedure and were personally interviewed. Windowing command frequencies, and screen layout characteristics were collected and analyzed. The data revealed a relatively high use of a small number of commands that were primarily concerned with moving between windows. This study enabled the creation of a more accurate windowing benchmark task.",
