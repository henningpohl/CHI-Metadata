  "abstract": "In many contexts, humans often represent their own \u201cneighborhood\u201d in great detail, yet only major landmarks further away. This suggests that such views (\u201cfisheye views\u201d) might be useful for the computer display of large information structures like programs, data bases, online text, etc. This paper explores fisheye views presenting, in turn, naturalistic studies, a general formalism, a specific instantiation, a resulting computer program, example displays and an evaluation.",
