  "abstract": "A method for interactive validation of transaction data with autocompletion is introduced and analyzed in a library information system for periodical publications. The system makes it possible to identify the periodicals by using the full title thus making a separate coding phase unnecessary. Only the characters that are needed to distinguish the title from other ones have to be typed. In our library this is in the average 4.3 characters. We have noticed that it is faster to use the auto-completion system compared with the use of short codes and a code catalogue. The auto-completion feature causes more errors at least for the novices because the work differs from normal typing. The errors are, however, very easy to correct with the assistance of the system.",
