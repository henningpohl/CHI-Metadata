  "abstract": "It has been argued for a long time that the representation of a problem is of crucial importance to understanding and solving it. Equally accepted is the fact that the human visual system is a powerful system to be used in information processing tasks. However, there, exist few systems which try to take advantage of these insights. We have constructed a variety of system components which automatically generate graphical representations of complex structures. We are pursuing the long-range goal of constructing a software oscilloscope which makes the invisible visible. Our tools are used in a variety of contexts: in programming environments, in intelligent tutoring systems, and in human-computer interaction in general by offering aesthetically pleasing interfaces.",
