  "abstract": "Runners want to actively explore unknown environments without the fear of getting lost. We conducted a survey to better understand runners\u2019 needs and practices in this context. The survey results emphasized the interest in flexible exploration. To address this interest, we designed FlexNav, a system that supports exploratory running through flexible tours that link the best runnable zones in a neighbourhood. FlexNav provides adaptive navigation support enabling runners to follow such tours without continually getting disruptive directions. We tested it with runners to assess its usability. The results confirm the usefulness of the system and the users' preference for flexible tours over fully specified tours with turn-by-turn guidance. Our study highlights the subjective nature of runnable zones and the subtle balance between guidance and exploration.",
