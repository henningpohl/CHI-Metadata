  "abstract": "This paper offers a theoretical and methodological framework of \u2018techno-aesthetic encounters\u2019 that supports nonlinear (situated, materially-driven, and multi-sensory) and art-based modes of inquiry in HCI and the broader STEM fields. We first investigate recent literatures in HCI and science and technology studies (STS) that explore nonlinear modes of practice and creativity in processes of technology design, and argue that better recognition of these dynamics may open space for art-based and nonlinear leaners and makers to more actively engage in HCI research and design. To meet this need, we study three renowned art-and-engineering practitioners (Kl\u00fcver, Paik, Moog) and our own experimental project titled \u2018The Electronicists\u2019 in which participants from different disciplines collaborated to produce three hybrid works. Based on this work, we propose a framework of \u2018techno-aesthetic encounters\u2019 that pursues event-based creativity through the mediation of engineering, art, and humanistic engagements. We suggest trust-based experiments, error-engaged studio, and art-based ethnography as promising methodological tenets of this approach.",
