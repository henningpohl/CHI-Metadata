  "abstract": "Although child participation is required for successful Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, it is challenging because the child\u2019s young age and immaturity make it difficult to perform self-care. Thus, parental caregivers are expected to be heavily involved in their child\u2019s everyday illness management. Our study aims to investigate how children and parents collaborate to manage T1D and examine how the children become more independent in their self-management through the support of their parents. Through semi-structured interviews with children with T1D and their parents (N=41), our study showed that children\u2019s knowledge of illness management and motivation for self-care were crucial for their transition towards independence. Based on these two factors, we identified four types of children\u2019s collaboration (i.e., dependent, resistant, eager, and independent) and parents\u2019 strategies for supporting their children\u2019s independence. We suggest design implications for technologies to support collaborative care by improving children\u2019s transition to independent illness management.",
