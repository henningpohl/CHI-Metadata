  "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (VR) is being used as an enriching experience for people living in residential aged care, or nursing homes, where care staff play a critical role supporting clients to use VR. In HCI research concerned with technology use in aged care, however, the role of formal caregivers has received limited attention. We conducted interviews with 11 caregivers working in care homes that have implemented VR as part of the social program offered to residents. Our findings highlight tensions between the opportunities created by the immersive VR experience and the risks and challenges full immersion presents for people in aged care. In this paper, we draw on an ethics of care framework to make visible the care practices involved in facilitating VR in aged care homes, highlighting the care required to ensure that older adults experience benefits when using immersive VR, while risks and challenges are carefully managed.",
