  "abstract": "Online platforms commonly collect and display user-generated information to support subsequent users\u2019 decision-making. However, studies have noticed that presenting collective information can pose social influences on individuals\u2019 opinions and alter their preferences accordingly. It is essential to deepen understanding of people\u2019s preferences when exposed to others\u2019 opinions and the underlying cognitive mechanisms to address potential biases. Hence, we conducted a laboratory study to investigate how products\u2019 ratings and reviews influence participants\u2019 stated preferences and cognitive responses assessed by their Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The results showed that social ratings and reviews could alter participants\u2019 preferences and affect their status of attention, working memory, and emotion. We further conducted predictive analyses to show that participants\u2019 Electroencephalography-based measures can achieve higher power than behavioral measures to discriminate how collective information is displayed to users. We discuss the design implications informed by the results to shed light on the design of collective rating systems.",
