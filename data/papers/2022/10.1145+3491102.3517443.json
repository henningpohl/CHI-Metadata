  "abstract": "Decision-making involves biases from past experiences, which are difficult to perceive and eliminate. We investigate a specific type of anchoring bias, in which decision-makers are anchored by their own recent decisions, e.g.\u00a0a college admission officer sequentially reviewing students. We propose an algorithm that identifies existing anchored decisions, reduces sequential dependencies to previous decisions, and mitigates decision inaccuracies post-hoc with 2% increased agreement to ground-truth on a large-scale college admission decision data set. A crowd-sourced study validates this algorithm on product preferences (5% increased agreement). To avoid biased decisions ex-ante, we propose a procedure that presents instances in an order that reduces anchoring bias in real-time. Tested in another crowd-sourced study, it reduces bias and increases agreement to ground-truth by 7%. Our work reinforces individuals with similar characteristics to be treated similarly, independent of when they were reviewed in the decision-making process.",
