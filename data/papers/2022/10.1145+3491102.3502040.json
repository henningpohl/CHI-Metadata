  "abstract": "There is a great deal of interest in the role that partisanship, and cross-party animosity in particular, plays in interactions on social media. Most prior research, however, must infer users\u2019 judgments of others\u2019 posts from engagement data. Here, we leverage data from Birdwatch, Twitter\u2019s crowdsourced fact-checking pilot program, to directly measure judgments of whether other users\u2019 tweets are misleading, and whether other users\u2019 free-text evaluations of third-party tweets are helpful. For both sets of judgments, we find that contextual features \u2013 in particular, the partisanship of the users \u2013 are far more predictive of judgments than the content of the tweets and evaluations themselves. Specifically, users are more likely to write negative evaluations of tweets from counter-partisans; and are more likely to rate evaluations from counter-partisans as unhelpful. Our findings provide clear evidence that Birdwatch users preferentially challenge content from those with whom they disagree politically. While not necessarily indicating that Birdwatch is ineffective for identifying misleading content, these results demonstrate the important role that partisanship can play in content evaluation. Platform designers must consider the ramifications of partisanship when implementing crowdsourcing programs.",
