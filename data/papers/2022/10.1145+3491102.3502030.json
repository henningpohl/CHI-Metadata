  "abstract": "Large language models (LMs) offer unprecedented language generation capabilities and exciting opportunities for interaction design. However, their highly context-dependent capabilities are difficult to grasp and are often subjectively interpreted. In this paper, we argue that by curating and analyzing large interaction datasets, the HCI community can foster more incisive examinations of LMs\u2019 generative capabilities. Exemplifying this approach, we present CoAuthor, a dataset designed for revealing GPT-3\u2019s capabilities in assisting creative and argumentative writing. CoAuthor captures rich interactions between 63 writers and four instances of GPT-3 across 1445 writing sessions. We demonstrate that CoAuthor can address questions about GPT-3\u2019s language, ideation, and collaboration capabilities, and reveal its contribution as a writing \u201ccollaborator\u201d under various definitions of good collaboration. Finally, we discuss how this work may facilitate a more principled discussion around LMs\u2019 promises and pitfalls in relation to interaction design. The dataset and an interface for replaying the writing sessions are publicly available at https://coauthor.stanford.edu.",
