  "abstract": "In a study of everyday digital identity, a set of primary drawings were made by researchers in online focus group settings as a way to capture our participants\u2019 spoken narratives of hyper-[in]security in the usages of digital identity. In a second stage of work, key extracts from the drawings were collaged using the method described in the paper, allowing an exploratory qualitative cartography of hyper-[in]security to be constructed. These secondary collages group the [in]securities thematically without losing essential contextual information. Samples of our data are given, to illustrate the contribution of the method to experience-centred design, with special reference to security from the perspective of marginalised and underserved communities. We discuss our method as a step towards multidimensional cognitive mapping of the salient features of our participants\u2019 narratives about hyper-[in]security, potentially paving the way for further world building explorations of digital identity futures.",
