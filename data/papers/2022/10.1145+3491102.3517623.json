  "abstract": "Recent HCI research has sought to develop guidelines\u2014\u2018heuristics\u2019, \u2018best practices\u2019, \u2018principles\u2019 and so on\u2014for voice user interfaces (VUI) to aid both practitioners and researchers in improving the quality of VUI-based design. However, limited research is available on how such design knowledge is conceptualised and used by industry practitioners. We present a small interview-based study conducted with 9 experienced VUI industry practitioners. Their concerns range from terminological challenges associated with VUI design knowledge, the role of codifications of such knowledge like design guidelines alongside their practical design work, through to their views on the value of \u2018harmonisation\u2019 of VUI design knowledge. Given the complex\u2014albeit preliminary\u2014picture that emerges, we argue for HCI's deeper consideration of how design knowledge meshes with the contingencies of practice, so that VUI design knowledge\u2014such as design guidelines developed in HCI\u2014delivers the most potential value for industry practice.",
