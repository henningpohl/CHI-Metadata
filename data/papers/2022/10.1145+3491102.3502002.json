  "abstract": "Research on the emotional experience of playing videogames has increased in recent years, yet much of this work is focused on the hedonistic player experience (PX) commonly associated with the nebulous concept of \u2018fun\u2019 and positive affect. Researchers are increasingly paying more attention to the eudaimonic PX commonly associated with \u2018appreciation\u2019, mixed-affect and reflection. To further investigate eudaimonic PX we interviewed 24 games players about \u2018significant or memorable emotional experiences\u2019 from their games playing and used grounded theory to analyse their responses. This led to the construction of the concept of \u2018emotional exploration\u2019 which is used to help explain (i) why players would seek out a eudaimonic PX, (ii) how eudaimonic PX is constituted and (iii) how developers can design for a eudaimonic PX. We further make the case for the \u2018eudaimonic gameplay experience\u2019 to be realised as different and separate to pre-existing notions of eudaimonic entertainment.",
