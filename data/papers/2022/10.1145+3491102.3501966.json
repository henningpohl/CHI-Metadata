  "abstract": "Blind users rely on alternative text (alt-text) to understand an image; however, alt-text is often missing. AI-generated captions are a more scalable alternative, but they often miss crucial details or are completely incorrect, which users may still falsely trust. In this work, we sought to determine how additional information could help users better judge the correctness of AI-generated captions. We developed\u00a0ImageExplorer, a touch-based multi-layered image exploration system that allows users to explore the spatial layout and information hierarchies of images, and compared it with popular text-based (Facebook) and touch-based (Seeing AI) image exploration systems in a study with 12 blind participants. We found that exploration was generally successful in encouraging skepticism towards imperfect captions. Moreover, many participants preferred\u00a0ImageExplorer for its multi-layered and spatial information presentation, and Facebook for its summary and ease of use. Finally, we identify design improvements for effective and explainable image exploration systems for blind users.",
