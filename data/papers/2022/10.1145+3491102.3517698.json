  "abstract": "Face orientation can often indicate users\u2019 intended interaction target. In this paper, we propose FaceOri, a novel face tracking technique based on acoustic ranging using earphones. FaceOri can leverage the speaker on a commodity device to emit an ultrasonic chirp, which is picked up by the set of microphones on the user\u2019s earphone, and then processed to calculate the distance from each microphone to the device. These measurements are used to derive the user\u2019s face orientation and distance with respect to the device. We conduct a ground truth comparison and user study to evaluate FaceOri\u2019s performance. The results show that the system can determine whether the user orients to the device at a 93.5% accuracy within a 1.5 meters range. Furthermore, FaceOri can continuously track user\u2019s head orientation with a median absolute error of 10.9 mm in the distance, 3.7\u00b0 in yaw, and 5.8\u00b0 in pitch. FaceOri can allow for convenient hands-free control of devices and produce more intelligent context-aware interactions.",
