  "abstract": "Mobile Robotic Telepresence (MRP) systems are remotely controlled, mobile videoconferencing devices that allow the remote user to move independently and have a physical presence in the environment. This paper presents a longitudinal study of MRP use in the home, where the first author used an MRP to connect with family, her partner, and friends over a six-month period. Taking an ethnomethodological approach, we present video recorded fragments to explore the phenomenon of \u2018visiting\u2019 where MRP users drop into the home for a period of time. We unpack the more \u2018procedural\u2019 elements\u2014arriving and departing\u2014alongside ways of \u2018dwelling\u2019 together during a visit, and the qualities of mobility, autonomous presence and spontaneity that emerge.",
