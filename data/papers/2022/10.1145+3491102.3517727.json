  "abstract": "Data Videos (DVs), or animated infographics that tell stories with data, are becoming increasingly popular. Despite their potential to induce attitude change, little is explored about how to produce effective DVs. This paper describes two studies that explored factors linked to the potential of health DVs to improve viewers\u2019 behavioural change intentions. We investigated: 1) how viewers\u2019 affect is linked to their behavioural change intentions; 2) how these affect are linked to the viewers\u2019 personality traits; 3) which attributes of DVs are linked to their persuasive potential. Results from both studies indicated that viewers\u2019 negative affect lowered their behavioural change intentions. Individuals with higher neuroticism exhibited higher negative affect and were harder to convince. Finally, Study 2 proved that providing any solutions to the health problem, presented in the DV, made the viewers perceive the videos as more actionable while lowering their negative affect, and importantly, induced higher behavioural change intentions.",
