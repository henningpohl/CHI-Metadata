  "abstract": "COVID-19 exposure-notification apps have struggled to gain adoption. Existing literature posits as potential causes of this low adoption: privacy concerns, insufficient data transparency, and the type of appeal \u2013 collective- vs. individual-good \u2013 used to frame the app. As policy guidance suggests using tailored advertising to evaluate the effects of these factors, we present the first field study of COVID-19 contact tracing apps with a randomized, control trial of 14 different advertisements for CovidDefense, Louisiana\u2019s COVID-19 exposure-notification app. We find that all three hypothesized factors \u2013 privacy, data transparency, and appeals framing \u2013 relate to app adoption, even when controlling for age, gender, and community density. Our results offer (1) the first field evidence supporting the use of collective-good appeals, (2) nuanced findings regarding the efficacy of data and privacy transparency, the effects of which are moderated by appeal framing and potential users\u2019 demographics, and (3) field-evidence-based guidance for future efforts to encourage pro-social health technology adoption.",
