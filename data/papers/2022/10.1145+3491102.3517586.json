  "abstract": "Aging in place technologies are designed to extend independence and autonomy in older adults, promoting quality of life and peace of mind. Prior work has described how adoption and continued use of these technologies are low when they are perceived as reinforcing aging stigma or reminding older adults of negative aspects of aging. Building on past research, we investigate older adults\u2019 perceptions of four different kinds of aging in place technologies. Based on in-depth interviews with 18 older adults using a set of scenarios, we describe how different design characteristics contribute to perceived aging stigma. Additionally, we draw on Duner & Nordstr\u00f6m\u2019s classification of coping strategies to discuss how specific kinds of technology can best support older adults during different stages of the aging process.",
