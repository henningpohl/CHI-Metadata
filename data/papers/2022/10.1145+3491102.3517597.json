  "abstract": "A transition to renewable energy increases the risks of disruptions when electricity supply does not meet demand.\u00a0HCI\u00a0has explored how digital technologies can mitigate such problems in households through support for reducing or shifting electricity use. However, faster transitions may be possible if some disturbances can be\u00a0acceptable\u00a0and households are supported in adapting to them. In this paper, we present a study of 21 Swedish households and their experiences of and ideas on how to manage disruptions in electricity supply. We call this perspective\u00a0household energy resilience\u00a0and identify three strategies for resilience: (1)\u00a0response diversity, i.e., diversity in ways of carrying out normally electricity-dependent practices, (2) creating\u00a0opportunities to develop resilience, and (3) building\u00a0community energy resilience. Furthermore, we suggest how\u00a0HCI\u00a0can support these strategies, both by providing tools to increase resilience and by carefully designing technology and services to be more resilient in themselves.",
