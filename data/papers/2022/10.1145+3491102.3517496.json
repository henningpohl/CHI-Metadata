  "abstract": "We investigate instant-messaging (IM) users\u2019 sense-making and practices around read-receipts: a feature of IM apps for supporting the awareness of turn-taking, i.e., whether a message recipient has read a message. Using a grounded-theory approach, we highlight the importance of five contextual factors \u2013 situational, relational, interactional, conversational, and personal \u2013 that shape the variety of IM users\u2019 sense-making about read-receipts and strategies for utilizing them in different settings. This approach yields a 21-part typology comprising five types of senders\u2019 speculation about why their messages with read-receipts have not been answered; eight types of recipients\u2019 causes/reasons behind such non-response; and four types of senders\u2019 and recipients\u2019 subsequent strategies, respectively. Mismatches between senders\u2019 speculations about un-responded-to read-receipted messages (URRMs) and recipients\u2019 self-reported explanations are also discussed as sources of communicative friction. The findings reveal that, beyond indicating turn-taking, read-receipts have been leveraged as a strategic tool for various purposes in interpersonal relations.",
