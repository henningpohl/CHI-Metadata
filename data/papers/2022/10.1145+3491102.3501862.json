  "abstract": "Choosing what to eat requires navigating a large volume of information and various competing factors. While recommendation systems are an effective approach to assist users with this culinary decision-making, they typically prioritise similarity to a query or user profile to give relevant results. This can expose users to an increasingly narrow band of phenomena, which could compromise dietary diversity, a factor in dietary quality. We designed Q-Chef, which combines a recipe recommendation system with a personalised model of surprise, and conducted a study to identify if surprise-eliciting recipes affect food decisions. Our study utilises a rigorous thematic analysis with over 40 participants to explore how computational models of surprise influence recipe choice. We also explored how these factors differed when people were presented with \u201csurprising-yet-tasty\u201d recipes, as opposed to just \u201ctasty\u201d recipes, and identified that being presented with surprising choices is more likely to elicit situational interest and prompt reflection on choices. We conclude with a set of suggestions for the design of future surprise-eliciting recipe systems.",
