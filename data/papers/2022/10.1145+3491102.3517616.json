  "abstract": "Attention-management tools can restrict online communication, but may cause collateral damage to their users\u2019 fulfillment of communication expectations. This paper explores the idea of integrating attention management into instant messaging (IM), by 1) disclosing restriction status via an online status indicator (OSI) to manage contacts\u2019 expectations, and 2) imposing communication limits to reduce communication distraction. We used a speed-dating design method to allow 43 participants to rapidly compare 48 types of OSI restriction in various conversational contexts. We identified two \u201ctug-of-wars\u201d that take place when attention management is integrated into IM apps: one between fulfilling one\u2019s contacts\u2019 expectations and protecting one\u2019s own attention, and the other, between protecting one\u2019s privacy and asserting the justifiability of using communication restrictions. We also highlighted the participants\u2019 desire to be diplomatic for sustaining their positive images and maintaining relational connectedness. Finally, we provide design recommendations for integrating attention management into IM apps.",
