  "abstract": "We conduct the first comprehensive study of the behavioral factors which predict leader emergence within open source software (OSS) virtual teams. We leverage the full history of developers\u2019 interactions with their teammates and projects at github.com between January 2010 and April 2017 (representing about 133 million interactions) to establish that \u2013 contrary to a common narrative describing open source as a pure \u201ctechnical meritocracy\u201d \u2013 developers\u2019 communication abilities and community building skills are significant predictors of whether they emerge as team leaders. Inspirational communication therefore appears as central to the process of leader emergence in virtual teams, even in a setting like OSS, where technical contributions have often been conceptualized as the sole pathway to gaining community recognition. Those results should be of interest to researchers and practitioners theorizing about OSS in particular and, more generally, leadership in geographically dispersed virtual teams, as well as to online community managers.",
