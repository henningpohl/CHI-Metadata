  "abstract": "Previous research shows that laypeople\u2019s trust in a machine learning model can be affected by both performance measurements of the model on the aggregate level and performance estimates on individual predictions. However, it is unclear how people would trust the model when multiple performance indicators are presented at the same time. We conduct an exploratory human-subject experiment to answer this question. We find that while the level of model confidence significantly affects people\u2019s belief in model accuracy, both the model\u2019s stated and observed accuracy generally have a larger impact on people\u2019s willingness to follow the model\u2019s predictions as well as their self-reported levels of trust in the model, especially after observing the model\u2019s performance in practice. We hope the empirical evidence reported in this work could open doors to further studies to advance understanding of how people perceive, process, and react to performance-related information of machine learning.",
