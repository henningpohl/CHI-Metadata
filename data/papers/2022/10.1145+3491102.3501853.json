  "abstract": "Maker culture encourages do-it-yourself practices to create, repair, and repurpose technology. In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, it is seen as a means of empowering people, providing affordable and customisable technology with potential to enrich areas such as education or assistive technology. To investigate this alleged potential, we performed an anthropological inquiry at an elementary school for disabled children that lasted one year, participating in everyday activities with students, teachers, and therapists. We observed \u2018heterogeneity in a fluid environment\u2019 and \u2018creativity in the moment\u2019 in an \u2018endemically underfunded\u2019 setting. We saw how technology is \u2018injecting dependencies\u2019, \u2018reinforcing disability\u2019, and \u2018occupying time and space\u2019, changing our view on the role that making can have. Leveraging Empowerment Theory, we highlight how (making) technology risks ignoring the intertwined dynamics between the individual, the organisational, and the community, and articulate points for reflection for technology in schools for disabled children for the HCI research community.",
