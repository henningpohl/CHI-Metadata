  "abstract": "The paper reflects on three approaches to the dissemination and display of digital art. \\'1c\"s[edition]\\'1d\" is a novel, web-based service that offers limited editions of \"\\'1cdigital prints\"\\'1d. Analysis of user comments suggests that the metaphor of a \\'1c\"limited digital edition\"\\'1d raises issues and to some extent is resisted. The second approach is the Flickr Brushes Gallery, where digital painters post images and comment on one another's work. Analysis of comment boards indicates that the shared art and comments are a form of gift exchange. Finally, the paper discusses a field study in which artists exhibited their work as it develops over time in digital frames and also in an immersive digital projection room. Analysis of field notes and interviews indicate that the digital frame approach was unsuccessful because of aesthetic and environmental concerns. The immersive projection suggested that more experiential approaches may be more interesting. It is argued that there is an inherent resistance in digital media to previous models of art commoditization. None of the approaches discussed here resolve the dilemma but rather indicate the scope and complexity of the issues.",
