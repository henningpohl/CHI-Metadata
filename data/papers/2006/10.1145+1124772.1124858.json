  "abstract": "Recently a number of researchers have uncovered various ways in which paper documents support everyday work practice and have suggested how these may be reflected in the design of new technologies. In this paper we consider how activities on and around paper documents may be supported when participants are remote from each other. When we consider the uses of an experimental system that provides a number of resources for supporting work over documents, it becomes apparent how critical it is to support apparently simple pointing and referencing, and how complex such conduct can be. This suggests some considerations both for developers of enhanced media spaces and analysts of everyday conduct.Clarified descriptions of technology and fragments including changes to figures. Added points concerning the scope of the technology the conception of sequence and calrified the requirement regarding redundancy. Revised descriptions of fragments in an atempt to make thsee less dense Corrected several typographic errors including those mentioned by the reviewers' gesture.",
