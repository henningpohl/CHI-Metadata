  "abstract": "Ride-sharing can potentially address transportation challenges such as traffic congestion and air pollution by letting drivers share their cars unused capacity with a number of passengers. However, even though multiple ride-sharing services exist and HCI\u00a0research has\u00a0investigated various aspects of their use, we still have limited knowledge on how\u00a0passengers use ride-sharing services to plan their trips. In this paper, we study\u00a0how passengers use existing services to support\u00a0the activity of planning a trip. We report\u00a0from a qualitative study where we participated\u00a0in 5 rides and conducted interviews with 19 passengers about their use and\u00a0opinions towards ride-sharing services. We found that planning a\u00a0ride involves comparing individual preferences across a\u00a0number of services\u00a0which enabled participants to support finding a trip and handle challenges such as privacy and trust. Further, we discuss these findings and their implications for future HCI research in ride-sharing.",
