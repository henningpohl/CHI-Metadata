  "abstract": "Text messaging-based conversational systems, popularly called chatbots, have seen massive growth lately. Recent work on evaluating chatbots has found that there exists a mismatch between the chatbot's state of understanding (also called context) and the user's perception of the chatbot's understanding. Users found it difficult to use chatbots for complex tasks as the users were uncertain of the chatbots' intelligence level and contextual state. In this work, we propose Convey (CONtext View), a window added to the chatbot interface, displaying the conversational context and providing interactions with the context values. We conducted a usability evaluation of Convey with 16 participants. Participants preferred using chatbot with Convey and found it to be easier to use, less mentally demanding, faster, and more intuitive compared to a default chatbot without Convey. The paper concludes with a discussion of the design implications offered by Convey.",
