  "abstract": "Advances in sensing technologies allow for using the forearm as a touch surface to give input to off-skin displays. However, it is unclear how users perceive the mapping between an on-skin input area and an off-skin display area. We empirically describe such mappings to improve on-skin interaction. We collected discrete and continuous touch data in a study where participants mapped display content from an AR headset, a smartwatch, and a desktop display to their forearm. We model those mappings and estimate input accuracy from the spreads of touch data. Subsequently, we show how to use the models for designing touch surfaces to the forearm for a given display area, input type, and touch resolution.",
