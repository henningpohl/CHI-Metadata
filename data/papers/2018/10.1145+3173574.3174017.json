  "abstract": "Most studies of executive function (EF) in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) focus on cognitive information processing, emphasizing less the social interaction deficits core to ASD. We designed a mobile game that uses social and nonsocial stimuli to assess children's EF skills. The game comprised three components involving different EF skills: cognitive flexibility (shifting/inference), inhibitory control, and short-term memory. By recruiting 65 children with and without ASD to play the mobile game, we investigated the potential of such platforms for capturing important phenotypic characteristics of individuals with autism. Results highlighted between-diagnostic-group differences in playing patterns with children with ASD showing broad patterns of EF deficits, but with relative strengths in nonsocial short-term memory, and preserved response to emotional inhibition cues. We showed the system could predict IQ, an important target for clinical treatment, towards the goal of developing platforms to act as long-term, efficient, and effective behavioral biomarkers for ASD.",
