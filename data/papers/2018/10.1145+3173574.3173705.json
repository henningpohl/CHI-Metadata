  "abstract": "Digital pens emit ink on paper and digitize handwriting. The range of the pen is typically limited to a special writing surface on which the pen's tip is tracked. We present Pentelligence, a pen for handwritten digit recognition that operates on regular paper and does not require a separate tracking device. It senses the pen tip's motions and sound emissions when stroking. Pen motions and writing sounds exhibit complementary properties. Combining both types of sensor data substantially improves the recognition rate. Hilbert envelopes of the writing sounds and mean-filtered motion data are fed to neural networks for majority voting. The results on a dataset of 9408 handwritten digits taken from 26 individuals show that motion+sound outperforms single-sensor approaches at an accuracy of 78.4% for 10 test users. Retraining the networks for a single writer on a dataset of 2120 samples increased the precision to 100% for single handwritten digits at an overall accuracy of 98.3%.",
