  "abstract": "his paper reports on design strategies for critical and experimental work that remains constructive. We report findings from a design workshop that explored the \"home hub\" space through \"imaginary design workbooks\". These feature ambiguous images and annotations written in an invented language to suggest a design space without specifying any particular idea. Many of the concepts and narratives which emerged from the workshop focused on extreme situations: some thoughtful, some dystopian, some even mythic. One of the workshop ideas was then developed with a senior social worker who works with young offenders. A \"digital social worker\" concept was developed and critiqued simultaneously. We draw on Foucault's history of surveillance to \"defamiliarise\" both the home hub technology and the current youth justice system. We argue that the dichotomy between \"constructive\" and \"critical\" design is false because design is never neutral.",
