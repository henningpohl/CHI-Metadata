  "abstract": "We present a system designed to enable learners of a foreign language to read materials that are personally interesting to them from the web and practice vocabulary with interactive exercises based on their past readings. We report on the results of deploying the system for one month with three classes of Dutch highschool students learning French. The students and their teacher were positive about the system and in particular about the personalization aspects that the system enables.",
