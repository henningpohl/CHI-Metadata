  "abstract": "We consider the challenge of motivating and coordinating large numbers of people to contribute to solving local, communal problems through their existing routines. In order to design such \"on-the-go crowdsourcing\" systems, there is a need for mechanisms that can effectively coordinate contributions to address problem solving needs in the physical world while leveraging people's existing mobility with minimal disruption. We thus introduce Hit-or-Wait, a general decision-theoretic mechanism that intelligently controls decisions over when to notify a person of a task, in ways that reason both about system needs across tasks and about a helper's changing patterns of mobility. Through simulations and a field study in the context of community-based lost-and-found, we demonstrate that using Hit-or-Wait enables a system to make efficient use of people's contributions with minimal disruptions to their routines without the need for explicit coordination. Interviews with field study participants further suggest that highlighting an individual's contribution to the global goal may help people value their contributions more.",
