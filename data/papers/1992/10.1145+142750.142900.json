  "abstract": "This paper describes an approach to developing systems which can be summarised as \u2018analyse top-down, design middle-out, and build bottom-up\u2019. A case study is described in which this approach is used to develop a system to support staff who select new products for a major UK company. The novelty of the approach lies in its use of task analysis to define an appropriate domain for the system and then the use of a working prototype to grow a system from the bottom up. The project involved using simple development tools which allowed the users to start getting business benefit from the system right from the start. Their use could therefore develop as the system evolved.",
