  "abstract": "The Graphic StoryWriter (GSW) is an interactive system that enables its users to create structurally complete stories through the manipulation of graphic objects in a simulated storybook. A rule-based story engine manages character and prop interaction, guides story development, and generates text. Through the simple interface and story writing engine, the Graphic StoryWriter provides an environment for early readers to learn about story structures, to experience the relationship between pictures and text, and to experiment with causal effects. This paper describes the motivation for and design of the Graphic StoryWriter, and reports on an empirical comparison of childrens' stories generated orally and using the GSW.",
