  "abstract": "Computer support for group work is a technological innovation receiving considerable attention from developmental researchers. This paper reports the preliminary results from two surveys which assessed user perceived needs for various types of group work support. The instruments, distributed to managers and professionals in a variety of organizations, described group support scenarios and associated functions/tools and asked for an assessment of their usefulness to one of the respondent's organizational work groups. Support for between meetings group work was perceived to be more useful than support for either face to face or electronic meetings. Common single user tools were generally perceived to be more useful than multi-user group tools. Individual differences and implications are addressed.",
