  "abstract": "This paper describes \u201cBook Window\u201d that we implemented, a window system based on the \u201cbook\u201d metaphor, that displays information not by scrolling but by using the animation of paging through. The BookWindow system equips some bookmarks, tabs, etc., by which we can access to an expected page through our requirements. BookWindow can support our work environment which navigates us through information space flexibly, because human beings are quite familiar with \u201cbooks\u201d.",
