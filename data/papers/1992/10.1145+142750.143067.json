  "abstract": "The Video Viewer is a communication tool that allows two users to share video information across a network. The design of this tool was based on the results of a case study involving two multimedia, collaborative workstations situated in two separate rooms. Users performed several tasks collaboratively using different media in an unstructured environment (i.e., there were four monitors to increase screen space and there was no specific interface for guidance). This video outlines the case study, the preliminary case study results and how these results effected the interface design of the Video Viewer.",
