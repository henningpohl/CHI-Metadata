  "abstract": "Common wisdom states rapid prototyping will result in a better product. Many tools are available to assist the practitioner in producing prototypes. Yet, few indications exist to show rapid prototyping has substantially improved how products are built.\nThis panel will look at the following issues: Can rapid prototyping dramatically improve product development? How do developers integrate rapid prototyping into their existing development process? Are high fidelity tools helpful or do they actually impede development? What is the ideal prototype and how can we build it?",
