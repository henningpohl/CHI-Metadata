  "abstract": "In this case study, we describe a design workshop with 7 children age 4-6 using existing co-design techniques known to elicit design insights in older individuals. We found that our 5- and 6-year-old participants successfully generated design ideas using these methods, while 4-year-olds were unable to use create solutions in a traditional format. How-ever, these younger children enthusiastically offered opportunities where, with methodological guidance, the research-er could have followed the child's lead and shifted the design question to one that was potentially more meaningful for the participant. We propose a future work to examine the effectiveness of giving these younger participants great-er authority in defining and scoping the problem space.",
