  "abstract": "We present Co-3Deator, a sketch-based collaborative 3D modeling system based on the notion of \"team-first\" ideation tools, where the needs and processes of the entire design team come before that of an individual designer. Co-3Deator includes two specific team-first features: a concept component hierarchy which provides a design representation suitable for multi-level sharing and reusing of design information, and a collaborative design explorer for storing, viewing, and accessing hierarchical design data during collaborative design activities. We conduct two controlled user studies, one with individual designers to elicit the form and functionality of the collaborative design explorer, and the other with design teams to evaluate the utility of the concept component hierarchy and design explorer towards collaborative design ideation. Our results support our rationale for both of the proposed team-first collaboration mechanisms and suggest further ways to streamline collaborative design.",
