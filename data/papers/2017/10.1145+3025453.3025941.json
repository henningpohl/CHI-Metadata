  "abstract": "We contribute in this work on gesture recognition to improve the accessibility of touch screens for people with low vision. We examine the accuracy of popular recognizers for gestures produced by people with and without visual impairments, and we show that the user-independent accuracy of $P, the best recognizer among those evaluated, is small for people with low vision (83.8%), despite $P being very effective for gestures produced by people without visual impairments (95.9%). By carefully analyzing the gesture articulations produced by people with low vision, we inform key algorithmic revisions for the P recognizer, which we call P+. We show significant accuracy improvements of $P+ for gestures produced by people with low vision, from 83.8% to 94.7% on average and up to 98.2%, and 3x faster execution times compared to P.",
