  "abstract": "The study compares self-reported computer experience (CE) obtained from children in computer-assisted and paper-and-pencil self-administered questionnaires. Twenty primary school children aged between 8 and 9 years completed a set of CE questions in both forms of administration in a Latin-square order. Findings show that young children can use both methods, and that they are able to answer a computer-based questionnaire just as consistently as a paper-based questionnaire.",
