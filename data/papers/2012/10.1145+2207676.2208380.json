  "abstract": "We introduce AccessRank, an algorithm that predicts revisitations and reuse in many contexts, such as file accesses, website visits, window switches, and command lines. AccessRank uses many sources of input to generate its predictions, including recency, frequency, temporal clustering, and time of day. Simulations based on log records of real user interaction across a diverse range of applications show that AccessRank more accurately predicts upcoming accesses than other algorithms. The prediction lists generated by AccessRank are also shown to be more stable than other algorithms that have good predictive capability, which can be important for usability when items are presented in lists as users can rely on their spatial memory for target location. Finally, we present examples of how real world applications might use AccessRank.",
