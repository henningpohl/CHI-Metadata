  "abstract": "Since its introduction at CHI 2004, the ESP Game has inspired many similar games that share the goal of gathering data from players. This paper introduces a new mechanism for collecting labeled data using \"games with a purpose.\" In this mechanism, players are provided with either the same or a different object, and asked to describe that object to each other. Based on each other's descriptions, players must decide whether they have the same object or not. We explain why this new mechanism is superior for input data with certain characteristics, introduce an enjoyable new game called \"TagATune\" that collects tags for music clips via this mechanism, and present findings on the data that is collected by this game.",
