  "abstract": "Going My Way is a mobile user-aware route planner. The system collects GPS data of a user's everyday locations and provides directions from an automatically selected set of landmarks that are close to the destination, informed by the user's usual travel patterns. In this paper, we present a brief description of the system, the results of a preliminary experiment in memory and recognition of landmarks, in addition to the results of a user evaluation of the system.",
