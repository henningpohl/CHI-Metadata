  "abstract": "The object-oriented history mechanism of the GINA application framework and its relevance for multi-user applications are demonstrated. The interaction history of a document is represented as a tree of command objects. Synchronous cooperation is supported by replicating the document state and exchanging command objects. Asynchronous cooperation leads to different branches of the history tree which can later be merged.",
