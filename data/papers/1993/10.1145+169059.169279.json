  "abstract": "The graphical user interface (GUI) typically provides a multi-windowed environment within a flat workspace or \u201cdesktop.\u201d Simultaneously, however, controls for executing commands within this interface are increasingly being rendered three-dimensionally. This paper explores ways in which the space of the GUI desktop might be literally and figuratively deepened through the incorporation of visual devices that have emerged during the history of art\u2014specifically, perspective and light effects. By enriching the visual vocabulary of the GUI, greater semantic complexity becomes sustainable.",

      "text": "Axonometric and isometric projection are used in drawing to depict objects dimensionally, but without regard to true perspective. Isometric projection places the face of an object parallel to the picture plane, utilizes no vanishing points, and typically ignores foreshortening. Axonometric projection places the face of an object atan angle to the picture plane and displays the top of the object as if in plan (bird's eye) view. New Wave utilizes axonometric projection in its icon drawing style.",
