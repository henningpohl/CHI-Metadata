  "abstract": "This paper addresses the phenomenon of emotional attachments to mobile phones. We introduce the term \"mobile attachment\" and define it as a bond between a person's self and a mobile phone that varies in strength. Based on a critical reflection of interdisciplinary literature, a conceptual mobile attachment model is developed. Within this model causes, consequences and influencing factors of mobile attachment are exposed and elaborated. We argue that mobile attachment emerges when the mobile phone becomes part of the user's self concept. The link between the user and their mobile phone may be fostered when it empowers, enriches, or gratifies the user's self. Attachment causes lead to \"design space determinants\" that enable user experience designers to design for mobile attachment. Attachment consequences may be operationalized for user experience evaluation.",
