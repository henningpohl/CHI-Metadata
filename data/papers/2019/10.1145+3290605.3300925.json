  "abstract": "Orientation is an emerging issue in cinematic Virtual Reality (VR), as viewers may fail in locating points of interest. Recent strategies to tackle this research problem have investigated the role of cues, specifically diegetic sound effects. In this paper, we examine the use of sound spatialization for orientation purposes, namely by studying different spatialization conditions (\"none\", \"partial\", and \"full\" spatial manipulation) of multitrack soundtracks. We performed a between-subject mixed-methods study with 36 participants, aided by Cue Control, a tool we developed for dynamic spatial sound editing and data collection/analysis. Based on existing literature on orientation cues in 360\u00ba and theories on human listening, we discuss situations in which the spatialization was more effective (namely, \"full\" spatial manipulation both when using only music and when combining music and diegetic effects), and how this can be used by creators of 360\u00ba videos.",
