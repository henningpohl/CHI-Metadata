  "abstract": "Natural language would seem to have a strong effect on users' behavior with artificial command languages for interacting with computer systems. We can divide the potential effects of natural language on command languages into: (a) effects on the names of commands, (b) effects on command arguments, and (c) effects on how command-argument units are interrelated (see Black and Sebrechts [2]). Others have investigated arguments (Barnard et al. [1]) and command-argument interrelations (Carroll [4]). In this paper, we describe our research concerning the first of these\u2014namely, how the names of commands effect the learnability and memorability of the commands. Our investigation uses text-editing as the specific domain. Applied research in human-computer interaction is a subtle affair, with many pitfalls awaiting the unwary researcher. Thus, in addition to presenting research results, we will conclude this paper with some methodological lessons.",
