  "abstract": "Writing functional system specifications is a significant job in the early stages of most system development programs. Computer aids for automatic generation of draft material could help produce comprehensive specifications more quickly. To create such computer aids, we must find some way to input defined requirements. A functional capabilities checklist has been proposed for that purpose. And we must find a way to output the appropriate words to describe those requirements. A novel technique called \u201cpatterned prose\u201d is proposed for this purpose. The use of patterned prose for automatic specification generation must still be evaluated in practical application. If that evaluation proves successful, this technique may offer promise as a means of organizing knowledge derived from past experience so that it can be used effectively in future work.",
