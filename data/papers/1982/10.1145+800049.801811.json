  "abstract": "There is little dispute that the main channels of intercommunication of people with the world at large are: sight, sound, and touch; and for people with other people: eye-contact, speech, gesture. Advanced human-computer interfaces increasingly implicate speech i/o, and touch or some form of manual input.",
