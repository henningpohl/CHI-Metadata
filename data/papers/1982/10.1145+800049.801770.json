  "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology for evaluating computer text editors from the viewpoint of their users\u2014from novices learning the editor to dedicated experts who have mastered the editor. The dimensions which this methodology addresses are: \u2014Time to perform edit tasks by experts. \u2014Errors made by experts. \u2014Learning of basic edit tasks by novices. \u2014Functionality over all possible edit tasks. The methodology is objective and thorough, yet easy to use. The criterion of objectivity implies that the evaluation scheme not be biased in favor of any particular editor's conceptual model\u2014its way of representing text and operations on the text. In addition, data is gathered by observing people who are equally familiar with each system. Thoroughness implies that several different aspects of editor usage be considered. Ease-of-use means that methodology is usable by editor designers, managers of word processing centers, or other non-psychologists who need this kind of information, but have limited time and equipment resources. In this paper, we explain the methodology first, then give some interesting empirical results from applying it to several editors.",
