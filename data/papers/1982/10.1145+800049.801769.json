  "abstract": "Increasing the productivity of programmers has become a \u201chot\u201d topic with both data processing managers and information systems researchers. Currently, there are not enough systems analysts and programmers available to develop all the applications that users need. Consequently, there is a need to produce more output from the available programmers and analysts. This has led to the development of tools and methods that aid analysts and programmers in system development. For example, automatic code generators simplify programming and debugging for many applications. Structured analysis and design methods aid developers in determining user needs and developing system specifications. There has been a great deal of literature written addressing the question: What affects do systems development aids have on the productivity of systems development personnel? This paper will summarize this body of literature from a research perspective. It will concentrate on aids used in business application development, focusing on the early stages of the software lifecycle: systems analysis, design, and coding.",
