  "abstract": "Videotex systems are two-way communnication systems intended to give users access to large amounts of stored information from their homes and offices. These systems link computer databases to modified television sets over the telephone network. A central computer is used as a large information storage device, monitoring requests for information from several users at one time, finding and sending the information to the person who requested it. It is possible however, that the addition of an inexpensive supplement to the hierarchical tree search will improve user search performance without substantially altering the cost-benefits of the menu selection approach. One such method of retrieval is the on-line alphabetical directory approach where users look for a search term from a list of alphabetically organized items by menu selection. An example will indicate the difference between this method and a typical hierarchical search:",
