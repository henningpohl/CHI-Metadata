  "abstract": "This paper describes an undergraduate human factors course which emphasizes psychologically oriented experimentation on the human use of computers. The reductionist principles of the scientific method are emphasized throughout the course: lucid statement of testable hypotheses, alteration of independent variables, measurement of dependent variables, selection and assignment of subjects, control for biasing, and statistical testing. Term-length team projects are highly motivating for students and have led to worthwhile research contributions.",
