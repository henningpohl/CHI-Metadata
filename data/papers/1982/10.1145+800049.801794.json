  "abstract": "An electronic mail system (EMS) has been in operation within Digital Equipment Corporation now for several years. The function of the system is to help serve the internal communication needs of this geographically distributed corporation. In particular, the system was intended to increase the effectiveness of managers, although secretaries, engineers, and other employees also use the system. As the mail system grew from a pilot operation to a global communications utility, the system's managers continued to receive a wide range of informal feedback concerning users' perceptions and utilization of the system. In order to assess reliably how users were reacting to this new communication mode, usage aspects of the electronic mail system were investigated by a random survey of the user population and by an analysis of EMS learning behavior. The survey portion of the study will be discussed in this paper.",
