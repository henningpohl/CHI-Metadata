  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the most appropriate level of language sophistication, or \u201creadability\u201d of the text of a computer-presented tutorial. The tutorial teaches first-time users how to operate a display terminal. The effects of readability on performance and attitudes of adults with different levels of reading ability were examined.",
