  "abstract": "Too often Human Factors guidelines or checklists are of limited value. The reasons for following them and the degree to which they should be followed are not always apparent. These problems in conjunction with the fact that they are usually full of words or concepts that are not adequately defined, result in guidelines which are misused and/or grossly under-consulted. A methodology will be advocated that will help alleviate these problems. This methodology, when followed, will produce guidelines which can be shown to be effective and are unambiguous in their use and interpretation. Guidelines produced by this procedure become useful tools for objectively evaluating software products.",
