  "abstract": "Design and user evaluation of a multimodal interaction style for music programming is described. User requirements were instant usability and optional use of a visual display. The interaction style consists of a visual roller metaphor. User control of the rollers proceeds by manipulating a force feedback trackball. Tactual and auditory cues strengthen the roller impression and support use without a visual display. The evaluation investigated task performance and procedural learning when performing music programming tasks with and without a visual display. No procedural instructions were provided. Tasks could be completed successfully with and without a visual display, though programming without a display needed more time to complete. Prior experience with a visual display did not improve performance without a visual display. When working without a display, procedures have to be acquired and remembered explicitly, as more procedures were remembered after working without a visual display. It is demonstrated that multimodality provides new ways to interact with music.",
