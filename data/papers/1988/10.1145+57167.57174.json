  "abstract": "Two experiments investigated various techniques for displaying the evaluation of LISP functions in an interactive debugger. The studies examined three techniques of highlighting the flow of evaluation in a LISP function and two display formats for displaying LISP function information. The subjects in both experiments included highly experienced LISP programmers and occasional LISP users with moderate to little LISP experience. The dependent measure was the subjects' preference rating for each display technique. The results showed that occasional LISP users preferred range highlighting, an interlaced display of evaluation results, and a simultaneous display of called functions. However, expert LISP programmers had no differential preferences for highlighting techniques.",
