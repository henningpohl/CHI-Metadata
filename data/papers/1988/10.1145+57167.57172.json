  "abstract": "Systems for animating algorithms have received considerable interest of late as effective means for understanding computer programs. Thus far, nothing has been reported in the literature concerning nature of the displays nor to what extent displays can be created automatically. This paper addresses these two issues. The first part presents a taxonomy of displays prevalent in algorithm animation systems; the second part uses the taxonomy to analyze those types of displays that can and cannot be created automatically from unmodified source code.",
