  "abstract": "Since humans direct their visual attention by means of eye movements, a device which monitors eye movements should be a natural \u201cpick\u201d device for selecting objects visually present on a monitor. The results from an experimental investigation of an eye tracker as a computer input device are presented. Three different methods were used to select the object looked at; these were a button press, prolonged fixation or \u201cdwell\u201d and an on screen select button. The results show that an eye tracker can be used as a fast selection device providing that the target size is not too small. If the targets are small speed declines and errors increase rapidly.",
