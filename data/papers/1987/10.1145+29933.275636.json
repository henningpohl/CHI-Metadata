  "abstract": "The presentation of an application program specifies how the data and operations provided by an application are presented to users. Most traditional techniques for implementing presentations lead to unstructured, unmodular implementations that are hard to construct and change. We present a model of presentation that identifies the dependencies between the presentation and functionality portions of an application. Based on this model, we show how several implementation techniques can be used to construct presentations in a modular way.",
