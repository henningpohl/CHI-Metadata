  "abstract": "A GOMS theory of stimulus-response compatibility is shown to predict response-time performance on a command/abbreviation encoding task. Working with parameters that were set by an earlier study and which have rational, task-meaningful interpretations as mapping, motor, perception and retrieval operators, zero-parameter predictions were made that fit the observed performance with r2 = 0.776 (p<0.05). The reasonableness of the parameters, the algorithms used to generate the predictions, and the weighting assumption used to combine algorithms into a single prediction are discussed.",
