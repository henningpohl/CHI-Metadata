  "abstract": "Constructs from theoretical psychology can be used to decompose the representational and processing resources of cognition. The decomposition supports \u201ccognitive task analysis\u201d through which user performance can be related to the functioning of resources. Such functional relationships have been formalised and embodied in an expert system. This builds approximate models which describe cognitive activity associated with the execution of dialogue tasks. Attributes of these \u201ccognitive task models\u201d can be used to predict likely properties of user performance.",
