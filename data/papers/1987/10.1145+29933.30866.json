  "abstract": "Syntax-directed editors were created with the intent of aiding in and improving the programming process. Despite their potential, they have not been successful, as evidenced by limited use. In general, they are perceived as being too difficult to use and the benefits of their use are outweighed by the difficulties.We believe that the cognitive styles and skills of the users have been ignored in the design process. In this paper we present some of our initial results which show that cognitive styles vary over a significant spectrum and that their consideration in the design of a syntax-directed editor will result in an intelligent tool that will be right for the cognitive skills and expertise of an individual user. In turn, an approach to design that takes cognitive variation into account would support the construction of syntax-directed editors which are successfully used.",
