  "abstract": "A scenario is an idealised but detailed description of a specific instance of human-computer interaction (HCI). A set of scenarios can be used as a \u201cfilter bank\u201d to weed out theories whose scope is too narrow for them to apply to many real HCI situations. By helping redress the balance between generality and accuracy in theories derived from cognitive psychology, this use of scenarios (1) allows the researcher to build on empirical findings already established while avoiding the tar-pits associated with the experimental methodology, (2) enables the researcher to consider a range of phenomena in a single study, thereby directly addressing the question of the scope of the theory, and (3) ensures that the resulting theory will be applicable in HCI contexts.",
