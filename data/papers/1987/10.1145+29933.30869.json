  "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of reconstructing the surface of three-dimensional objects, given a collection of planar contours representing cross-sections through the objects. This is an important problem, with applications in clinical medicine, bio-medical research and instruction, and industrial inspection. Current solutions to this problem have raised interesting theoretical questions about search techniques and the exploitation of domain-specific aspects of such search problems. In this paper, we survey known reconstruction techniques, describe a testbed for evaluating these techniques and present an improvement on the simple divide-and-conquer method analyzed by Fuchs, Kedem and Uselton [5].",
