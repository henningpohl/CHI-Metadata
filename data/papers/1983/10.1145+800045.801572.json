  "abstract": "This paper will not advocate list of firm recommendations about document design because it is recognised that design decisions will vary with many factors. Instead, the present discussion will emphasize that when making these decisions it is necessary for designers to take account of how readers will use the information provided. In order to help them do this, a simple framework is proposed which outlines the rudiments of how people interact with technical documents. The advantages of this framework will be illustrated by using it to motivate design decisions at two decision levels. At a \u201cmacro\u201d level the document designer must make broad decisions about the contents and format of the manual. At a \u201cmicro\u201d level the designer must select particular combinations of linguistic, graphic and typographic options which will help readers locate, understand and implement the information given in the manual.",
