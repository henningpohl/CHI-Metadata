  "abstract": "How can learning in text-editing be characterized? Much recent work has focused on the use of analogies from prior experience. In this paper, we investigate the retrievals of earlier experiences within the editor and how they might be used by analogy to accomplish the task and learn the editor. An experiment is presented that demonstrates the effects of these \u201cremindings\u201d on performance. In addition, some possible determinants of these remindings are investigated. This experiment points out the need to consider not only the general form of instruction, but also the specifics of the instructional sequence as well. Irrelevant aspects of the task may have strong effects on performance. We consider three teaching techniques, designed to take advantage of these effects in different ways.",
