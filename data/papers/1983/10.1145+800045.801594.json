  "abstract": "Designing a human interface to a computer system is more art than science. Systematic research on the human interface to computer systems, when it is performed, is generally an after-the-fact evaluation of an almost finished product. This sort of evaluation is often too specific to a particular product to provide general prescriptions for future interface design and often occurs too late to have a substantial impact on product development. Rarely do research and evaluation provide guidance throughout the development cycle. We propose that an examination of people's natural use of already existing computer systems, using research methods adopted from studies of social behavior (e.g., Kraut & Johnston, 1982; Hooff, 1982) will provide a richer source of information for guiding development. A multivariate examination of naturally occurring human-computer interaction may provide insights into its complex structure in ways that are denied to more experimentally oriented, human-factors research.",
