  "abstract": "As the technology of rule-based inference mechanisms matures, knowledge acquisition\u2014the creation, structuring, and verification of rules\u2014becomes increasingly important. The accuracy and completeness of the rules in the knowledge base determine expert system performance, and the cost of acquiring that knowledge base dominates all other hardware and software costs in practical systems. To reduce knowledge acquisition time and error rate, a new interactive graphics interface for rules is being designed and implemented in GE Corporate Research and Development. In the new system, each set of rules is represented as an AND/OR graph and parts of the rule base are displayed on a CRT screen as an AND/OR tree. A user\u2014even an unsophisticated user\u2014can navigate the AND/OR graph, identify nodes to be modified, analyze the behavior of the graph, verify its correctness graphically, and follow the execution of inference engines.",
