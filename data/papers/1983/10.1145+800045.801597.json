  "abstract": "C3 environments have increasingly incorporated computer controlled maps as decision aids. The design of map displays in space oriented C3 systems has taken on greater importance due to the complex spatial relationships among orbiting objects. The large number of objects orbiting the globe and their great speeds further complicates efforts to quickly and accurately portray their positions graphically. This paper describes an experimental plan aimed at evaluating a new 2D/3D \u201chybrid\u201d space situation map display. The Hybrid display is created by opening a globe at the south pole and flattening it into a platter. A third dimension is obtained by tilting the platter. It was hypothesized that the Hybrid display would offer an advantage to C3 system operators and analysts dealing with three dimensional problems. The test plan focuses on perceptual parameters and user preference issues concerning conventional and Hybrid display techniques. The results of this study will be examined to direct future work on dynamic displays, and the impact of display design approach on cognitive performance.",
