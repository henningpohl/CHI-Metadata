  "abstract": "Systematic differences in recognition/confusion due to font variation is estimated by using confusion matrices of the full 26 capital letters of the English alphabet in 5 \u00d7 7 dot matrix font and \u201cKeepsake\u201d conventional stroke font. Average correct recognition was controlled to 50% by limiting brightness and duration of tachistoscopic displays for each font to individually determined levels for each of the four subjects. Each stimulus symbol was presented 45 times to each subject, resulting in 180 trials per letter per font. By comparing the obtained data to that reported by Townsend (1971), Craig (1979) and Gilmore et al.(1979), estimates of the differences in recognition/confusion attributable to medium, font and subject differences were isolated. This comparison reveals a substantial difference in recognition/confusion processes when the observer sees the display on a video screen versus seeing it projected on a white screen.",
