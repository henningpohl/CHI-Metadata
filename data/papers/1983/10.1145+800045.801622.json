  "abstract": "A complete software package always includes documentation. Although its importance is often overlooked, documentation may be the only source of program design information. Major tasks in the software life cycle, such as design, coding, testing and maintenance, are often performed by different individuals. Lientz and Swanson (1979) found that, typically, only about half of a software system's maintenance personnel had been involved in its development. Poor documentation techniques can, therefore, dramatically increase labor costs throughout the labor intensive software life cycle by making both development and maintenance tasks more difficult. Recent research in this area (Boehm-Davis, Sheppard, & Bailey, 1982; Sheppard, Kruesi, & Bailey, in press; Sheppard, Kruesi, & Curtis, 1981) has been directed toward determining performance on a set of software tasks as a function of the type of documentation. In these studies, programmer performance was examined on comprehension, coding, debugging, and modification tasks as a function of the type of documentation provided. The documentation formats were constructed from the factorial combination of three types of symbology with three types of spatial arrangement. These formats were chosen because they represent the primary dimensions for categorizing the way in which available documentation aids configure the information they present to programmers (Jones, 1979). The three types of symbology in which information was presented consisted of normal English, abbreviated English (such as program design language), and ideograms. The spatial arrangements of the information used in these experiments were sequential, branching, and hierarchical. While each of the four tasks pursued in this research produced slightly different results, there was a general trend towards the superiority of succinct symbology and a branching spatial arrangement in each.",
