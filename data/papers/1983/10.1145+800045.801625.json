  "abstract": "Measuring procedures were developed to assess those lighting characteristics of VDTs which are of importance for visual comfort and for legibility: Luminance oscillation, sharpness, contrasts, stability and dimensions of characters as well as reflections on the display surfaces. 30 different VDT models of various European and US manufacturers disclosed great differences, indicating a big potential for improving the ergonomic qualities of VDTs.",
