  "abstract": "Two experimental tasks were designed to test use of multiple-button mice. In the first, number of errors made and time to complete subtasks were measured as subjects attempted to depress one, two, or three buttons under three sets of conditions. In the second, subjects were asked to indicate true or false either by pressing one of two different buttons or by clicking a single button one or two times. People tended to be faster and more accurate using different buttons than different numbers of clicks.",
