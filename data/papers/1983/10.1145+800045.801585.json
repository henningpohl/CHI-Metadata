  "abstract": "A methodology is described for obtaining objective measures of product usability. The Playback program developed at the IBM Human Factors Center in San Jose collects performance data of the user interface without impact upon the user or the system being evaluated. While a user is working with the system, keyboard activity is timed and recorded by a second computer. This log of stored activity is later played back through the host system for analysis. An observer watching television monitors enters time-stamped codes and comments concerning the users employment of system publications. The advantages of this approach are: (1) data-collection programs are external to the product being evaluated, (2) no modifications of the Playback program are required for testing different software applications, (3) the data-collection process does not intrude on the user's thoughts or activities, (4) problem determination is performed at an accelerated rate during playback analysis, and (5) all data collection is performed on line.",
