  "abstract": "The access and growing ubiquity of digital fabrication has ushered in a celebration of creativity and \u201cmaking.\u201d However, the focus is often on the resulting static artifact or the creative process and tools to design it. We envision a post-making process that extends past these final static objects \u2014 not just in their making but in their \u201cunmaking.\u201d By drawing from artistic movements such as Auto-Destructive Art, intentionally inverting well-established engineering principles of structurally sound designs, and safely misusing unstable materials, we demonstrate an important extension to making \u2014 unmaking. In this paper, we provide designers with a new vocabulary of unmaking operations within standard 3D modeling tools. We demonstrate how such designs can be realized using a novel multi-material 3D printing process. Finally, we detail how unmaking allows designs to change over time, is an ally to sustainability and re-usability, and captures themes of \u201caura,\u201d emotionality, and personalization.",
