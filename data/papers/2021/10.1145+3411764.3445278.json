  "abstract": "Maintaining an awareness of one\u2019s well-being and making work-related decisions to achieve work-life balance is critical for flexible long-hour workers. In this study, we propose that social sensing could address bottlenecks in worker\u2019s awareness, interpretation of the informatics, and subsequent behavioral change. We conducted a four-week technology probe study by recruiting flexible long-hour professional drivers (Taxi and Uber drivers) and their significant others to use a social sensing prototype which collects data from the drivers and shares it with their partners as well as incorporates partners\u2019 observations. We interviewed them before and after the probe study and found that while technological sensing was able to increase drivers\u2019 awareness of their well-being status and intention to modify behaviors. The \u201csocial sensing\u201d design was able to further shape such awareness or intention into action, highlighting the potential of using the sociotechnical approach in promoting work-life balance among long-hour workers.",
