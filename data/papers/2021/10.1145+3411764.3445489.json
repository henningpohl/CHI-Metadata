  "abstract": "User-driven intervention tools such as self-tracking help users to self-regulate problematic smartphone usage. These tools basically assume active user engagement, but prior studies warned a lack of user engagement over time. This paper proposes GoldenTime, a mobile app that promotes self-regulated usage behavior via system-driven proactive timeboxing and micro-financial incentives framed as gain or loss for behavioral reinforcement. We conducted a large-scale user study (n = 210) to explore how our proactive timeboxing and micro-financial incentives influence users\u2019 smartphone usage behaviors. Our findings show that GoldenTime\u2019s timeboxing based micro-financial incentives are effective in self-regulating smartphone usage, and incentive framing has a significant impact on user behavior. We provide practical design guidelines for persuasive technology design related to promoting digital wellbeing.",
