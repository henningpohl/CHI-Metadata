  "abstract": "This paper uses document theory to analyze Discover, a partially free-to-use application developed by Facebook\u2019s philanthropic initiative Connectivity and released in the Philippines in May 2020. Discover\u2019s design is predicated on the conviction that access to valorized forms of technology\u2014in this case, popular websites viewed via the Internet\u2014promises benefits to marginalized users who are presumed to lack resources needed to fully participate in contemporary informational capitalism. Document theory in HCI provides a framework that allows us to analyze the most popular websites as rendered by Discover. We argue that Discover\u2019s logic of redaction and form moderation reproduces the very structural inequality that access to the Internet frequently claims to ameliorate. We conclude by pointing to potential applications of our approach in research at the intersection of HCI, ICT4D, and political economy.",
