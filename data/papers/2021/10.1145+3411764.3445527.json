  "abstract": "Computational notebooks, which seamlessly interleave code with results, have become a popular tool for data scientists due to the iterative nature of exploratory tasks. However, notebooks provide a single execution state for users to manipulate through creating and manipulating variables. When exploring alternatives, data scientists must carefully create many-step manipulations in visually distant cells.  We conducted formative interviews with 6 professional data scientists, motivating design principles behind exposing multiple states. We introduce forking \u2014 creating a new interpreter session \u2014 and backtracking \u2014 navigating through previous states. We implement these interactions as an extension to notebooks that help data scientists more directly express and navigate through decision points a single notebook. In a qualitative evaluation, 11 professional data scientists found the tool would be useful for exploring alternatives and debugging code to create a predictive model. Their insights highlight further challenges to scaling this functionality.",
