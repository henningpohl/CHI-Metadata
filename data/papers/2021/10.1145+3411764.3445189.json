  "abstract": "Fertility tracking and technology are characterized by logging varied health-related data potentially associated with female fertility cycles. Such data are often seen as private and restricted to the individual level. We conducted an interview study with 21 people (16 in the U.S.) facing challenges to conceive and 5 U.S. healthcare providers specialized in infertility to analyze (in)fertility experiences with data. Our findings suggest that although fertility data are considered personal and private, they are embedded in larger ecological systems of use, influencing and being influenced by different stakeholders, institutional contexts, and sociocultural factors. Leveraging the Ecological Systems Theory, we analyze the relationships and factors shaping individuals\u2019 fertility trajectories, discussing how the different layers influence the work individuals have to engage and the burden imposed on them through various social, institutional, and cultural boundaries. We propose an ecological perspective on fertility data practices and discuss opportunities to counter-influence broader environmental systems through data tracking.",
