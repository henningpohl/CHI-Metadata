  "abstract": "The industry for children\u2019s apps is thriving at the cost of children\u2019s privacy: these apps routinely disclose children\u2019s data to multiple data trackers and ad networks. As children spend increasing time online, such exposure accumulates to long-term privacy risks. In this paper, we used a mixed-methods approach to investigate why this is happening and how developers might change their practices. We base our analysis against 5 leading data protection frameworks that set out requirements and recommendations for data collection in children\u2019s apps. To understand developers\u2019 perspectives and constraints, we conducted 134 surveys and 20 semi-structured interviews with popular Android children\u2019s app developers. Our analysis revealed that developers largely respect children\u2019s best interests; however, they have to make compromises due to limited monetisation options, perceived harmlessness of certain third-party libraries, and lack of availability of design guidelines. We identified concrete approaches and directions for future research to help overcome these barriers.",
