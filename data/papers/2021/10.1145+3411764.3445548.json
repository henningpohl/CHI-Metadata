  "abstract": "We examine a vocabulary of affective language, borrowed from Roland Barthes\u2019 \u201cA Lover\u2019s Discourse: Fragments,\u201d and its applicability to discourse describing smartphone attachment. This vocabulary, adopted from four of Barthes\u2019 terms, waiting, dependency, anxiety, and absence, is used as a discursive lens to illustrate some of the many ways people understand and engage with their relationships to their smartphones. Based on this, a survey is conducted, and a speculative technology probe is created in the form of an instrumented pillow for people to lock away their smartphones during the night. The pillow is deployed in a diary study in which five people sleep with their phone locked away for multiple nights. The self-reported and observed behaviours are presented in a selection of vignettes. The results support the proposed discursive lens and suggest future interdisciplinary strategies to investigate how people relate to interactive technology, using a combined approach of literary theory and a technology probe supported by survey and study data.",
