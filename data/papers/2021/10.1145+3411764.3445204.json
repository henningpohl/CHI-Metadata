  "abstract": "To understand the underlying process of users\u2019 information disclosure decisions, scholars often use either the privacy calculus framework or refer to heuristic shortcuts. It is unclear whether the decision process varies by age. Therefore, using these common frameworks, we conducted a web-based experiment with 94 participants, who were younger (ages 19-22) or older (65+) adults, to understand how perceived app trust, sensitivity of the data, and benefits of disclosure influence users disclosure decisions. Younger adults were more likely to change their perception of data sensitivity based on trust, while older adults were more likely to disclose information based on perceived benefits of disclosure. These results suggest older adults made more rationally calculated decisions than younger adults, who made heuristic decisions based on app trust. Our findings negate the mainstream narrative that older adults are less privacy-conscious than younger adults; instead, older adults weigh the benefits and risks of information disclosure.",
