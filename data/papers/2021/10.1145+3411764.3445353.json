  "abstract": "Music fans strategically support their artists. Their collective efforts can extend to social causes as well: In 2020 for example, ARMY\u2014the fandom of the music group BTS\u2014successfully organized the #MatchAMillion campaign to raise over one million USD to support Black Lives Matter. To better understand factors of fandoms\u2019 collaborative success for arguably unrelated social goals, we conducted a survey focusing on ARMYs\u2019 perceptions of their fandom and their social effort. Most ARMYs viewed the fandom as a community, loosely structured with pillar accounts. They reported trust in each other as well as high team composition, which mediated the relationship between their neutral psychological safety and high efficacy. Respondents attributed their success in #MatchAMillion to shared values, good teamwork, and established infrastructure. Our findings elucidate contextual factors that contribute to ARMY\u2019s collaborative success and highlight themes that may be applied to studying other fandoms and their collaborative efforts.",
