  "abstract": "People often capture photos or notes from their phones to integrate later into a document. But current mobile capture tools can make this hard, with the captured information ending up fragmented and decontextualized. This paper explores how to help document authors capture, contextualize, and use document-related information. A survey of 66 information workers reveals that document-focused information capture differs from other types of mobile information capture, and that while people capture a broad range of information types while mobile, most document-related capture comes in the form of photos, notes, and bookmarks. Based on this survey we built Scraps, which consists of two parts: 1) a mobile app that makes it easy for people to capture and add context to information from their phone, and 2) a Word sidebar that helps them later link that information to a document on their desktop. In a field study with 11 information workers, we find that Scraps streamlined the process of capturing and using document-related information, and enabled people to focus on writing over integrating captured information.",
