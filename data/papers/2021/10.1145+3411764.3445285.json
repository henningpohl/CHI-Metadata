  "abstract": "Tactile feedback is widely used to enhance realism in virtual reality (VR). When touching virtual objects, stiffness and roughness are common and obvious factors perceived by the users. Furthermore, when touching a surface with complicated surface structure, differences from not only stiffness and roughness but also surface height are crucial. To integrate these factors, we propose a pin-based handheld device, HairTouch, to provide stiffness differences, roughness differences, surface height differences and their combinations. HairTouch consists of two pins for the two finger segments close to the index fingertip, respectively. By controlling brush hairs\u2019 length and bending direction to change the hairs\u2019 elasticity and hair tip direction, each pin renders various stiffness and roughness, respectively. By further independently controlling the hairs\u2019 configuration and pins\u2019 height, versatile stiffness, roughness and surface height differences are achieved. We conducted a perception study to realize users\u2019 distinguishability of stiffness and roughness on each of the segments. Based on the results, we performed a VR experience study to verify that the tactile feedback from HairTouch enhances VR realism.",
