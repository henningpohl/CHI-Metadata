  "abstract": "The advancement of computational design and fabrication technologies has allowed combining physical and digital processes in architecture. Existing methods for physical-digital integration offer limited support for explorations with folded non-linear surfaces. This paper introduces a feedback-oriented design approach linking physical models with digital tools to enhance ideation processes in architecture. We employ paper as a medium for translating simple mock-up ideas to more elaborate digital design models. We explain the physical exploration, 3D scanning, digital simulation, and fabrication processes. Then, we discuss the results, observations, and limitations of this design approach.",
