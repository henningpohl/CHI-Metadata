  "abstract": "Online privacy policies should enable users to make informed decisions. Current text policies, however, lack usability: users often miss crucial information and consent to them without reading. Visual representation formats may increase comprehension, but are rarely used in practice. In an iterative design process we gathered qualitative feedback on typical policy contents and on existing and newly designed representation formats. We developed design guidelines and a Visual Interactive Privacy Policy based on the Privacy Policy Nutrition Label enriched with control options and further interactive elements. In an empirical evaluation, both visual representations received higher ratings of attractiveness, stimulation, novelty and transparency compared to a standard policy long text. Interactivity improved time spent with the policy. There were no effects on conversion rate, perceived control or perceived trust, efficiency and perspicuity. More research is needed, especially with regard to the cost-benefit ratio of visual privacy policies.",
