  "abstract": "Keyboard-based emoji entry can be challenging for people with visual impairments: users have to sequentially navigate emoji lists using screen readers to find their desired emojis, which is a slow and tedious process. In this work, we explore the design and benefits of emoji entry with speech input, a popular text entry method among people with visual impairments. After conducting interviews to understand blind or low vision (BLV) users\u2019 current emoji input experiences, we developed Voicemoji, which (1) outputs relevant emojis in response to voice commands, and (2) provides context-sensitive emoji suggestions through speech output. We also conducted a multi-stage evaluation study with six BLV participants from the United States and six BLV participants from China, finding that Voicemoji significantly reduced entry time by 91.2% and was preferred by all participants over the Apple iOS keyboard. Based on our findings, we present Voicemoji as a feasible solution for voice-based emoji entry.",
