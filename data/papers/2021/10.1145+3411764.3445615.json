  "abstract": "Video-conferencing is essential for many companies, but its limitations in conveying social cues can lead to ineffective meetings. We present MeetingCoach, an intelligent post-meeting feedback dashboard that summarizes contextual and behavioral meeting information. Through an exploratory survey\u00a0(N=120), we identified important signals\u00a0(e.g., turn taking, sentiment) and used these insights to create a wireframe dashboard. The design was evaluated with in situ participants\u00a0(N=16) who helped identify the components they would prefer in a post-meeting dashboard. After recording video-conferencing meetings of eight teams over four weeks, we developed an AI system to quantify the meeting features and created personalized dashboards for each participant. Through interviews and surveys\u00a0(N=23), we found that reviewing the dashboard helped improve attendees\u2019 awareness of meeting dynamics, with implications for improved effectiveness and inclusivity. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions for future feedback system designs of video-conferencing meetings.",
