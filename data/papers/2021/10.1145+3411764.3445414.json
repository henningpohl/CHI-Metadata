  "abstract": "HCI has historically provided little support for moving from fieldwork insights or theories to design outcomes. Having witnessed many students struggle and then justify their designs with a form of marketing hype, we developed a supporting approach of \u201cfield theories\u201d. A field theory is a working theory about salient interactions in a particular domain and sensitizing concepts in order to frame design investigations.\u00a0It is presented visually in a field theory diagram to support succinct communication and critique. Studying use of design prototypes that have been informed by a field theory helps to reflect upon and refine the theory.\u00a0In this paper we present examples from our HCI classes and reflections based on interviews with students. We discuss how field theories offer an orientation in the spirit of a \u2018bricoleur\u2019 who harnesses elements of theory and practice to produce deeper understandings and more fitting outcomes for the task at hand.",
