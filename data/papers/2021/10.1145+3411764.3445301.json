  "abstract": "A user's ownership perception of virtual objects, such as cloud files, is generally uncertain. Is this valid for streaming platforms featuring accounts designed for sharing (DS)? We observe sharing practices within DS accounts of streaming platforms and identify their ownership characteristics and unexpected complications through two mixed-method studies. Casual and Cost-splitting are the two sharing practices identified. The owner is the sole payer for the account in the former, whereas profile holders split the cost in the latter. We distinguish two types of ownership in each practice\u2014Primary and Dual. In Primary ownership, the account owner has the power to allow others to use the account; in Dual ownership, Primary ownership appears in conjunction with joint ownership, notably displaying asymmetric ownership perceptions among users. Conflicts arise when the sharing agreements collapse. Therefore, we propose design recommendations that bridge ownership differences based on sharing practices of DS accounts.",
