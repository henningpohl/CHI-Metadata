  "abstract": "The amount of autonomy in software engineering tools is increasing as developers build increasingly complex systems. We study factors influencing software engineers\u2019 trust in an autonomous tool situated in a high stakes workplace, because research in other contexts shows that too much or too little trust in autonomous tools can have negative consequences. We present the results of a ten week ethnographic case study of engineers collaborating with an autonomous tool to write control software at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to support high stakes missions. We find that trust in an autonomous software engineering tool in this setting was influenced by four main factors: the tool\u2019s transparency, usability, its social context, and the organization\u2019s associated processes. Our observations lead us to frame trust as a quality the operator places in their collaboration with the automated system, and we outline implications of this framing and other results for researchers studying trust in autonomous systems, designers of software engineering tools, and organizations conducting high stakes work with these tools.",
