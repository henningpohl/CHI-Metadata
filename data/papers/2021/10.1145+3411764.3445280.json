  "abstract": "There is a growing need to design augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices that focus on supporting quality of life goals, such as increased social participation in leisurely activities. Yet, designing AAC applications that support leisurely activities is difficult, as the activity might require novel and specific language in a timely manner. Through observations and contextual interviews with people with aphasia, their social partners, and speech-language therapists, we characterize the important but challenging nature of supporting one specific leisure activity: meal ordering in restaurants. Based on our observational and interview data, we design and explore three prototype AAC systems to support people with aphasia in ordering meals in restaurants. Each prototype integrates a different AI technology, contributing insights into how AI may enhance AAC usage and design. The study opens up questions of designing accessible restaurant experiences for neurodivergent people and the role of AI in AAC devices more broadly.",
