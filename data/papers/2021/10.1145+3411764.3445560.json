  "abstract": "Spatial computing devices that blend virtual and real worlds have the potential to soon become ubiquitous. Yet, creating experiences for spatial computing is non-trivial and needs skills in programming and 3D content creation, rendering them inaccessible to a wider group of users. We present SpatialProto, an in-situ spatial prototyping system for lowering the barrier to engage in spatial prototyping. With a depth-sensing capable mixed reality headset, SpatialProto lets users record animated objects of the real-world environment (e.g. paper, clay, people, or any other prop), extract only the relevant parts, and directly place and transform these recordings in their physical environment. We describe the design and implementation of SpatialProto, a user study evaluating the system\u2019s prototype with non-expert users (n = 9), and demonstrate applications where multiple captures are fused for compelling augmented reality experiences.",
