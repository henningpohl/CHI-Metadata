  "abstract": "We investigate how people\u2019s \u2018humor style\u2019 relates to their online photo-sharing behaviors and reactions to \u2018privacy primes\u2019. In an online experiment, we queried 437 participants about their humor style, likelihood to share photo-memes, and history of sharing others\u2019 photos. In two treatment conditions, participants were either primed to imagine themselves as the photo-subjects or to consider the photo-subjects\u2019 privacy before sharing memes. We found that participants who frequently use aggressive and self-deprecating humor were more likely to violate others\u2019 privacy by sharing photos. We also replicated the interventions\u2019 paradoxical effects\u00a0\u2013 increasing sharing likelihood\u00a0\u2013 as reported in earlier work and identified the subgroups that demonstrated this behavior through interaction analyses. When primed to consider the subjects\u2019 privacy, only humor deniers (participants who use humor infrequently) demonstrated increased sharing. In contrast, when imagining themselves as the photo-subjects, humor deniers, unlike other participants, did not increase the sharing of photos.",
