  "abstract": "Researchers have explored several avenues to mitigate data scientists\u2019 frustrations with computational notebooks, including: (1) live programming, to keep notebook results consistent and up to date; (2) supplementing scripting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), to improve ease of use; and (3) providing domain-specific languages (DSLs), to raise a script\u2019s level of abstraction. This paper introduces Glinda, which combines these three approaches by providing a live programming experience, with interactive results, for a domain-specific language for data science. The language\u2019s compiler uses an open-ended set of \u201crecipes\u201d to execute steps in the user\u2019s data science workflow. Each recipe is intended to combine the expressiveness of a written notation with the ease-of-use of a GUI. Live programming provides immediate feedback to a user\u2019s input, whether in the form of program edits or GUI gestures. In a qualitative evaluation with 12 professional data scientists, participants highly rated the live programming and interactive results. They found the language productive and sufficiently expressive and suggested opportunities to extend it.",
