  "abstract": "As an online community for discussing research findings, r/science has the potential to contribute to science outreach and communication with a broad audience. Yet previous work suggests that most of the active contributors on r/science are science-educated people rather than a lay general public. One potential reason is that r/science contributors might use a different, more specialized language than used in other subreddits. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the language used in more than 68 million posts and comments from 12 subreddits from 2018. We show that r/science uses a specialized language that is distinct from other subreddits. Transient (newer) authors of posts and comments on r/science use less specialized language than more frequent authors, and those that leave the community use less specialized language than those that stay, even when comparing their first comments. These findings suggest that the specialized language used in r/science has a gatekeeping effect, preventing participation by people whose language does not align with that used in r/science. By characterizing r/science's specialized language, we contribute guidelines and tools for increasing the number of contributors in r/science.",
