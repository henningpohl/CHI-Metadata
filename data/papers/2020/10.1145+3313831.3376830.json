  "abstract": "Leveraging existing popular games such as Pok\u00e9mon GO to promote health can engage people in healthy activities without sacrificing gaming appeal. However, little is known about what potential tensions arise from incorporating new health-related features to already existing and popular games and how to resolve those tensions from players' perspectives. In this paper, we identify design tensions surrounding the appeals of Pok\u00e9mon GO, perspectives on different health needs, and mobile health technologies. By conducting surveys and design workshops with 20 avid Pok\u00e9mon GO players, we demonstrate four design tensions: (1) diverse goals and rewards vs. data accuracy, (2) strong bonds between players and characters vs. gaming obsession, (3) collaborative play vs. social anxiety, and (4) connection of in-real-life experiences with the game vs. different individual contexts. We provide design implications to resolve these tensions in Pok\u00e9mon GO and discuss how to extend our findings to the broader context of health promotion in location-based games.",
