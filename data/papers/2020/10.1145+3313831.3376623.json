  "abstract": "Direct observation of behavior provides a unique type of data for reflecting on during a process of behavioral intervention. This study focuses on practitioners who specialize in operationalizing, recording, and monitoring behavior using data collection through paper-and-pencil or, increasingly, mobile computing. Applying an action research approach, we conducted fieldwork to understand observational data collection among practitioners providing children with special education support for behavioral needs. We present a model of collaborative data collection, which describes how practices are situated in the process of collecting data that are useful for reflection by teams of practitioners. We discuss how computer-assisted data collection could promote more systematic and rigorous practices, and design considerations for the collaborative aspects of collecting and reflecting on behavioral data. This study builds on research describing the practices of individuals who track their own behavioral data, and improves our understanding of informal documentation practices in organizations.",
