  "abstract": "The diagnosis of cancer brings about significant changes in the life of a child. In addition to physical pain, pediatric patients face psychological and social challenges. At the same time, some patients also have positive experiences with and attitudes toward their illness and treatment. Drawing on 19 semi-structured interviews with pairs of pediatric cancer patients and their parental caregivers, we examined patients' perspectives on their experience of living with cancer. We identified four salient themes in patients' positive experiences: future-oriented thinking, developing strong personal bonds and relationships, gaining knowledge and life experience, and developing self-management and coping skills. Collectively, the patients' positive experiences indicate that they adapt to their new lives through an evolving process. Based on this process, we provide design implications for health technologies to support and promote positive experiences during illness and treatment.",
