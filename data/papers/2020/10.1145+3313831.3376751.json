  "abstract": "Automated driving raises new human factors challenges. There is a paradox that allows drivers to perform non-driving related tasks (NDRTs), while benefiting from a driver who regularly attends to the driving task. Systems that aim to better manage a driver's attention, encouraging task switching and interleaving, may help address this paradox. However, a better understanding of how drivers self-interrupt while engaging in NDRTs is required to inform such systems. This paper presents a counterbalanced within-subject simulator study with N=42 participants experiencing automated driving in a familiar driving environment. Participants chose a TV show to watch on a HUD and mobile display during two 15min drives on the same route. Eye and head tracking data revealed more self-interruptions in the HUD condition, suggesting a higher likelihood of a higher situation awareness. Our results may benefit the design of future attention management systems by informing the visual and temporal integration of the driving and non-driving related task.",
