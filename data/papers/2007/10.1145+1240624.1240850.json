  "abstract": "This paper presents a quantitative human performance model of making single-stroke pen gestures within certain error constraints in terms of production time. Computed from the properties of Curves, Line segments, and Corners (CLC) in a gesture stroke, the model may serve as a foundation for the design and evaluation of existing and future gesture-based user interfaces at the basic motor control efficiency level, similar to the role of previous \"laws of action\" played to pointing, crossing or steering-based user interfaces. We report and discuss our experimental results on establishing and validating the CLC model, together with other basic empirical findings in stroke gesture production.",
