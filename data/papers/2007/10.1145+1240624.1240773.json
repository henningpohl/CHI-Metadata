  "abstract": "The increasing integration of education and technology has led to the development of a range of note-taking applications. Our project's goal is to provide empirical data to guide the design of such note-taking applications by evaluating the behavioral and learning outcomes of different note-taking functionality. The study reported here compares note-taking using a text editor and four interaction techniques. The two standard techniques are typing and copy-paste. The two novel techniques are restricted copy-paste and menu-selection, intended to increase attention and processing respectively. Hypothesized learning gains from the novel techniques were not observed. As implemented these techniques were less efficient and appeared to be more frustrating to use. However, data regarding differences in both note-taking efficiency and learning suggest several important implications for selection-based note-taking applications, such as pasting and highlighting. Our results also indicate that students have strong opinions regarding their note-taking practices, which may complicate potentially beneficial interventions.",
