  "abstract": "To date, efforts have been made to enable visually impaired people to gain access to graphics on the Internet. However, these studies only offer a solution for a specific type of graphic by using a fixed set of hardware. To address this, a design approach of an adaptive and adaptable architecture is introduced which adapts to different graphical content, input/output devices (including assistive technologies) and user's profile and preferences. This system brings the opportunity to visually impaired people to gain access to graphics via different modalities by providing an adequate accessibility interface and interaction based on their profiles and needs.",
