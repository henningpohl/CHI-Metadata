  "abstract": "Historically one of the visions for human-computer symbiosis has been to augment human intelligence and extend people's cognitive abilities. In this paper, we present two visually-based systems to enhance a person's ability to flexibly control their pace while engaged in a cognitively demanding activity. In these investigations, we explore pacing interfaces that minimize the cognitive demands for assessing a current pace, provide ambient cues that can be quickly interpreted without incurring significant interruption from the current task, and place knowledge in the world to flexibly support different pacing strategies. Evaluation of our pacing interfaces shows that technology can successfully support pacing.",
