  "abstract": "CARD (Collaborative Analysis of Requirements and Design) is an influential technique for participatory design and participatory analysis that is in use on three continents.  This paper reviews three case studies that document the development of a layered CARD approach, which distinguishes among the following: (1) observable, formal components, (2) skill and craft, and (3) interpretative description.  The layered approach simplifies the CARD materials, and moves the deliberately informal technique toward a more principled analysis.",
