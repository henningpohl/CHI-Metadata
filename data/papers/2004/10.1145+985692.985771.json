  "abstract": "Engineers at the Johnson Space Center recently combined the upper body of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robonaut system with a Robotic Mobility Platform (RMP) to make an extremely mobile humanoid robot designed to interact with human teammates. Virtual Reality gear that immerses a human operator into Robonaut's working environment provides the primary control pathway for remote operations. Human/robot interface challenges are addressed in the control system for teleoperators, console operators and humans working directly with the Robonaut. Multiple control modes are available for controlling the five fingered dexterous robot hands and operator selectable depending on the type of grasp required. A relative positioning system is used to maximize operator comfort during arm and head motions. Foot pedals control the mobility base. Initial tasks that include working with human rated tools, navigating hallways and cutting wires are presented and show the effectiveness of telepresence control for this class of robot.",
