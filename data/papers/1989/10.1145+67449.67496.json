  "abstract": "An experiment was conducted with people using gestures and speech to manipulate graphic images on a computer screen. A human was substituted for the recognition devices. The analysis showed that people strongly prefer to use both gestures and speech for the graphics manipulation and that they intuitively use multiple hands and multiple fingers in all three dimensions. There was surprising uniformity and simplicity in the gestures and speech. The analysis of these results provides strong encouragement for future development of integrated multi-modal interaction systems.",
