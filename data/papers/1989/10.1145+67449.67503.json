  "abstract": "The development of an interface design tool called \u201cdirected dialogue protocols\u201d is discussed. The tool is based upon Kato's (1986) method of verbal data collection, \u201cquestion-asking protocols.\u201d Three extensions to the question-asking method are detailed: 1) an experimental procedure of atomic tasks which facilitate the quantization of verbal data; 2) interventions by the experimenter that probe the subject's expectations and prompt verbalizations; and 3) a technique for answering subject queries called sequential disclosure. Also discussed are applications of the directed dialogue that have identified design choices which build learnability and usability into a product's user-interface.",
