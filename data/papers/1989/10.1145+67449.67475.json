  "abstract": "This paper discusses the design and applications of an object-oriented user interface management system (UIMS). Specifically, the Lockheed User Interface System (LUIS) is described. LUIS is based on a user interface model that includes declarative and procedural components. The package has been used by both non-programmers and programmers in several applications at Lockheed. Experiences derived from applications of the package are used to address several key issues in the UIMS field, such as procedural versus declarative specification, separation of the user interface from applications, UIMS flexibility, and UIMS support for design evaluation.",
