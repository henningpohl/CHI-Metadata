The decision to create EuroPARC was announced in November of 1986, and the lab was officially dedicated in June of 1988. EuroPARC's research charter is human-computer interaction. The research program is coordinated with PARC's, but the goal is to combine PARC-style systems research with European points of view, issues, and approaches.",
