  "abstract": "A method for selecting graphical objects with a mouse by circling them is described. Circling motions are detected automatically; no button presses are required. Trials conducted on a Sun 3 workstation indicate that, for the object size and layout chosen, even users experienced with mouse selection via button presses and unfamiliar with circling are able to select pairs of objects in approximately the same amount of time with either method. The number of target misses between circling and clicking also compare well for both single and paired object cases. Furthermore, many users showed a measurable preference for the circling method when given a choice.",
