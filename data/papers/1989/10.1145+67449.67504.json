  "abstract": "One need not create a natural language understanding system in order to create a hypertext data base that can be traversed with unconstrained natural language. The task is simplified because the computer creates a constrained context, imposes a non-negotiable topic, and elicits simple questions. Two small hypertext data bases describing the authors' organization and the terms and rules of baseball were implemented on an IBM PC. When ten untrained people were allowed to search through these data bases, 59 per cent of their queries were answered correctly by the first data base and 64 per cent by the second.",
