  "abstract": "Software for supporting groups of cooperating users \u2014 groupware \u2014 raises a number of new issues in user interface design. This paper gives a definition of groupware and presents a model of group tools based on active objects. The model has been applied to the design and implementation of an extensible groupware toolkit known as LIZA. The paper describes the architecture of LIZA. Examples of group tools running under LIZA are used to illustrate some of the problems in the design of multi-user interfaces.",
