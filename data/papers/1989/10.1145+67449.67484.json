  "abstract": "The lowly text cursor is a non-issue for most interface designers. Nonetheless, current text cursor designs suffer from at least two problems: one-off errors and a lack of visibility of function. These problems are exacerbated in an editing environment which uses the extremely fast Leap cursor-moving technology.This paper presents solutions to these cursor design problems and reveals the surprising way many other aspects of system design can be improved as a consequence of designing the cursor correctly.",

This form of cursor fits a mental model of text as a sequence better than it represents what actually happens on the display. On the Macintosh, if you try to put the cursor on a particular character it slips off to the fight or left, depending on whether you are to the fight or left of the center of the character.]]",

      "text": "One subject, a professional writer with good typing skills, after over three months experience with Leap, achieved an average cursor moving time of 1.34 seconds including Leaps to targets that were not on-screen. The times were measured in the process of ordinary editing. We observe that this is considerably less than the 2.02 seconds average time for the use of a mouse by an experienced user for on-screen moves cited in Card, Moran, and NeweU, The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1983, pg. 237. Since our time measurement was from initial press of a Leap key to the resumption of typing rather than to the moment the cursor lands on target, we have added (in accordance with the techniques given in the cited work) an extra homing time to the mouse time to make the results more directly comparable. The advantage of Leap over a mouse in moving to off-screen targets (where the mouse-based system must resort to scroll-bars or other special techniques) is considerably greater.]] ",
