  "abstract": "Easy learning of a user interface depends in part on users being able to generalize successfully about it. Philosophical doctrine, and some recent work in human-computer interaction, argues that causal analysis of interactions can support generalization. But neither the philosophical literature nor the HCI literature provides a rigorous theory of causal analysis adequate for problems in human-computer interaction. We propose such a rigorous theory here, and show how it accounts for two robust generalizations, using certain general assumptions. We then present evidence that these assumptions are accepted by people. Finally we compare this theory with other treatments of consistency.",
