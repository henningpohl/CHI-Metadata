  "abstract": "This paper presents a view of system design that shows how good engineering practice can lead to poor user interfaces. From the engineer's perspective, the ideal interface reflects the underlying mechanism and affords direct access to the control points of the mechanism. The designer of the user interface is often also the designer of the mechanism (or at least is very familiar with the mechanism), and thus has a strong bias toward basing the interface on the engineering model. The user, however, wants to complete a task, and an interface that is based on the task is often more appropriate than one based on the system mechanism. We discuss these issues, and also discuss where to position the user interface between the poles of the engineering model and the task model.",
