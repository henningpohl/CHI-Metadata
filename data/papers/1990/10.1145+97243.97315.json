  "abstract": "An experiment investigated the organization of declarative knowledge about the human computer interface (HCI). Two groups of experts in user interface design (human factors experts and software experts), and a control group sorted HCI concepts into categories. The data were transformed into measures of dissimilarity and analyzed using (1) hierarchical cluster analysis and (2) Pathfinder, a program that generates network representations of the data. Both expert groups had greater numbers of clusters, more elaborate clusters, and better organized networks than did the controls. The two expert groups differed with respect to the clustering of concepts related to display coding and software. The Pathfinder networks for the two expert groups differed in organization, with human factors experts' networks consisting of highly interrelated subnetworks and software experts networks consisting of central nodes and fewer, less interconnected subnetworks. The networks also differed in the number of concepts linked with such concepts as graphics, natural language, function keys, and speech recognition. The discussion focuses on (1) specific differences in cognitive models between HCI experts and novices and between different types of experts, and (2) the role of cognitive models in HCI design and in communications within a multidisciplinary design team.",
