  "abstract": "The business instrument panel uses visualization to present, in a comprehensive and integrated manner, all the important elements found in traditional financial statements. By means of analog representation in a simple computer generated picture, the business instrument panel replaces the four traditional financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and retained earnings statement). The business instrument panel also embodies a new paradigm for understanding the business world and empowers the user with an unparalleled quick understanding of any firm.",
