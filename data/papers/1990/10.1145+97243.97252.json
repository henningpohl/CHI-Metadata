  "abstract": "The Propositional Production System (PPS) for describing interactive dialogs is defined. It is shown to be a superset of state machines, window event translation tables and event response systems. It is shown how dialogs can be expanded by means of inheritance and how semantic control information can be uniformly integrated into the dialog model. Optimizations are defined which can tune the executable machine for either minimal space or minimal execution time.",
