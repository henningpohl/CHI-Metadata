  "abstract": "This paper discusses the user interface of the Capture Lab, a computer-supported meeting room that has been in operation since late 1987. One goal of the Capture Lab design is to support meetings of business people (who are often novice computer users) without requiring an additional person to serve as a computer technician or facilitator. This paper discusses the user interface features a system should have to support face to face meetings. It describes the Capture Lab and how it is used, and presents our approach to satisfying those interface requirements. Finally, we discuss a few of our observations about the Capture Lab's user interface, and how a computer-supported meeting environment affects meetings.",
