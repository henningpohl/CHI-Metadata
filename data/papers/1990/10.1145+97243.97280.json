  "abstract": "Much of the research in the field of human/computer interface is aimed at the interface designer who begins from scratch. A different set of needs confronts the designer who must update an existing interface without throwing away the good elements of the old design and the knowledge base of experienced users.\nIn this paper, the factors that contribute to the need for interface changes are presented, along with the special challenges that make change more difficult than new design. Approaches are suggested for dealing with the problems of updating an interface to make it effective for both old and new users.",
