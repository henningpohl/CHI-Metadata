  "abstract": "A curriculum was developed to introduce users to the Smalltalk object-oriented programming language. Applying the Minimalist model of instruction [3], we developed a set of example-based learning scenarios aimed at supporting real work, getting started fast, reasoning and improvising, coordinating system and text, supporting error recognition and recovery, and exploiting prior knowledge. We describe our initial curriculum design as well as the significant changes that have taken place as we have observed it in use.",
