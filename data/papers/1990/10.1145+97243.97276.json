  "abstract": "Claims of increased pointing speed by users and manufacturers of variable-gain mice (\u201cpowermice\u201d) have become rife. Yet, there have been no demonstrations of this claim, and theoretical considerations suggest it may not even be true. In this paper, the claim is tested.\nA search of the design space of powermice failed to find a design point that improved performance compared to a standard mouse. No setting for the gain for a constant-gain mouse was found that improved performance. No threshold setting for a variable gain mouse was found that improved performance. In fact, even gain and threshold combinations favored by powermouse enthusiasts failed to improve performance. It is suggested that the real source of enthusiasm for powermice is that users are willing to accept reduced pointing speed in return for a smaller desk footprint.",
