  "abstract": "An interactive electronic information kiosk was created for the CHI '89 conference. Based on Macintosh\u00ae technology, the \u201cInfoBooth\u201d included a custom HyperCard\u00ae interface built by a team at Apple Computer.\nThe design was initiated by examining the desires of potential users. Design changes, influenced by the results of informal user testing, were numerous. During the conference, user actions were recorded using an embedded \u201ctrace\u201d program to allow for later usage assessment.\nThis paper offers a case study for designers of similar systems. Aspects of the pre-conference design evolution are described. The impact of user testing is discussed and findings from the analysis of the trace data are presented.",
