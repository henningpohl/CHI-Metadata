  "abstract": "This paper describes the implementation of semantic snapping \u2014 an interaction technique that provides semantic feedback at the lexical level while dragging a graphical object on the screen. Like conventional snapping, or gravity fields, semantic snapping includes a geometric component where objects in close proximity are drawn together or \u201csnap\u201d into position. However, semantic snapping goes further by allowing non-geometric (semantic) properties of objects to place additional constraints on snapping. Semantic snapping also provides more complex lexical feedback which reflects potential semantic consequences of a snap. This paper motivates the use of semantic snapping and describes how this technique has been implemented in a window-based toolkit. This implementation works in an adaptive manner to provide the best interactive response in situations where semantic tests are very time consuming and strain the limits of acceptable performance.",
