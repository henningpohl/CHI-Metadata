  "abstract": "By default, we attempt to define practical areas of technological endeavor as \u201capplications.\u201d For example, the applied psychology of human-computer interaction has characteristically been defined in terms of the methods and concepts basic psychology can provide. This has not worked well. An alternative approach is to begin from a characterization of current practice, to take seriously the requirements of the domain of endeavor, and to define areas of \u201cscience\u201d and \u201capplication\u201d as possible and appropriate in that context.",
