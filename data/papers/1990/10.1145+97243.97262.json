  "abstract": "GOMS models of telephone toll and assistance operators (TAOS) are being constructed in an effort to provide theoretical predictions of expert performance on several dedicated workstations. This applied effort has pushed the development of GOMS modeling techniques into the area of speech input and output, and into a task where information is not always available when it is required by the TAO. This paper describes the task, heuristics for constructing the GOMS models, and parameters for making quantitative predictions of performance time.",
