  "abstract": "A strategy for organizing the social science computer user community is presented. The strategy recognizes that social scientists have exceptional educational needs and unfavorable budgetary constraints. A series of workshops is proposed to reduce curriculum redundancy and avoid the costly \"on demand\" mode of consultation that has developed in most computer centers. An example of a workshop is provided.",
