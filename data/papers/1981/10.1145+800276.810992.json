  "abstract": "The presentation deals with two questions:1) What makes games so captivating?2) How can the same features (that make computer games captivating) be used to make other user interfaces more interesting and enjoyable to use?First, three empirical studies are described. These studies analyze which features of several computer games are most important in making the games enjoyable. Then a set of heuristics for incorporating these features in other user interfaces will be outlined. The heuristics are organized in three categories: challenge, fantasy and curiosity.",
