  "abstract": "In most general purpose computer systems there is a wide variety\nof software available to users. Such software is usually provided\nin one of three organisational forms - routines in a library;\ncollections of related functions grouped in a package with a common\ninterface; independent programs called through operating system\ncommands. This interdependent tripartite structure creates problems\nfor non-sophisticated users as it involves different levels of user\ninterface complexity.At the routine level a user must write\nprograms in an appropriate host programming language to use the\nsoftware. If he wishes to use a selection of routines written in\nincompatible languages then he may have to familiarise himself with\nmore than one host language. In each language he must be aware of\nthe calling conventions for routines, the possible representations\nof various types of data, the methods of passing parameters and the\nways of inputting and outputting data to and from the external\nenvironment. This type of interface occurs with libraries like NAG\nand IMSL.\nIn the case of packages the imperative user interface is usually\nsomewhat simpler, consisting essentially of a name identifying the\nfunction required and some associated parameters which identify\nvariables, labels, files, options, control and code values, etc as\nappropriate. However, function calls of this form must normally be\npreceded by a non-trivial amount of declarative and other \"red\ntape\" information expressed in the package interface language.\nAlso, package environments can be restrictive in that the user is\nconstrained to the types of data structure and analysis supported\nby the chosen package unless he is prepared to write programs to\ntransform his data for other packages or to analyse it\nindependently. SPSS is typical of this kind of package.\nWhen software facilities are provided at the program level, the\nuser interface often consists simply of one-line program invocation\ncommands written in the local operating system's command language,\nwith program options and data files identified by command\nparameters. Common examples of such facilities are sort and\narchiving programs. A program level interface becomes even simpler,\nand at the same time more powerful, if command sequences can be\nformed into parameterised command procedures and if programs are\nenabled to conmlunicate directly with one another without the need\nfor explicit intermediate files.\nIn the latter type of environment the application software user\ngenerally finds that there are analytic program tools available to\nmeet only some of his requirements. Consequently he has to embrace\neither or both of the other levels in addition in order to increase\nthe analytic power available to him. Transfer between levels is not\neasily accomplished in most systems as facilities do not normally\nexist to help the user move data between levels. This difficulty\ncomes on top of the obvious problem of having to master more than\none interface and more than one level of complexity.\nIn the SENSE project (11), which is funded by the U.K. Social\nScience Research Council, we are creating a prototype computing\nenvironment for social science researchers which can accommodate\nnon-sophisticated users. The aim is to provide an integrated\nenvironment where such users will have a complete range of\napplication software available (packages, routines and programs)\nthrough a single, simple user interface. We believe that this can\nbe achieved by exploiting and extending the concept of software\ntools propounded by Kernighan and Plauger (19), so that as far as\npossible all software can be used through a program level\ninterface, with its attendant advantages. Following Kernighan and\nPlauger we believe that software tools \"can be used to create a\ncomfortable and effective interface to existing programs\", as well\nas providing an ideal model for the structuring of brand new\napplication software. This paper will consider various aspects of\nthe initial design of the SENSE software environment with\nparticular reference to the importance of software tools in that\ndesign.",
