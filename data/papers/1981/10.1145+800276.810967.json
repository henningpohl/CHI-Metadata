  "abstract": "This paper discusses the construction of an experimental database at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories using the REL ENGLISH software provided by Frederick and Bozena Thompson of the California Institute of Technology. Of special interest is the quasi-natural interface and its ability to tolerate ambiguities. This provides a support mechanism for multiple user views of the same data in which disambiguation is accomplished during semantic processing.",
