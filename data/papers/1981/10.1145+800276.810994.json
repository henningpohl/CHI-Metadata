  "abstract": "CONFER emerged from a concern with small group governance in\nboth its communications and decision making dimensions. This\ncontext will be described as well as the principles operationalized\nin the CONFER system: individual equality, freedom, privacy and\nflexibility, and the facilitation of individual participation.\nCONFER is based on the proposition that effective communication is\nan active process for all concerned. This activity is strongly\nencouraged in CONFER through a number of mechanisms designed to\nfacilitate interaction between the user and the CONFER system, as\nwell as interaction among all the users of the system. As well,\ngrowth of the system over time is promoted by interaction of the\nsystem designer with the user community.\nThe development of Merit's use of CONFER was aided greatly by\nour continuing close relationship with Dr. Parnes and by the\nparticipation of many members of the Merit staff in the CONFERence\nfor CONFER development that he eventually began. As we identified\nnew aspects of CONFER use, we usually also were able to think of\nchanges to CONFER that would facilitate them. For example, as we\nbegan to realize how important was the general conversation among\nour users--a critical need for the isolated user in particular--we\nled the lobbying effort for changes to make the voting structure\nmore interactive. In response, CONFER over the years has radically\naltered the default form of participant comments from its original\nformal and anonymous style to a conversational model. Similarly, as\nCAUCUS grew to enormous size we asked for (and got) aids in\nmanaging, and then in re-starting, large Conferences. In a\nremarkably short time, CAUCUS became a general meeting place for\nmany who were not Merit users at all, simply because it offered a\nplace for users to meet one another and share problems and\nsolutions. Eventually CAUCUS gave birth to a general-purpose\nCONFERence for users of one of the host systems--an idea that has\nsince been implemented elsewhere as well.\nThe growing use of CAUCUS as a communications medium for Merit\nstaff eventually resulted in the birth of a CONFERence for that\nspecific purpose. Before the use of CONFER there had been\nrelatively little communication between the staff members at the\ncentral site and those located at the host computing centers except\nfor occasional face-to-face meetings that were largely reportorial\nin content. Once CAUCUS showed the staff that network issues could\nbe discussed in real time and that input from the host staffs could\nhave weight, the pattern of decision-making began to change. With\nthe inception of the MNET:STAFF CONFERence, and the resulting\nprivacy for internal discussions, the role of the staff\nmembers--both centrally-located and at the hosts--continues to grow\nas we expound, lobby, and negotiate on network issues while (or\neven before) they are happening.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that we members of the Merit staff\ncould not do the job we do without CONFER. Merit's primary goal is\nto facilitate the use of remote computer resources for a\nheterogeneous and dispersed community of users. Without CONFER we\nwould be working harder to accomplish much less of this\nobjective.",
