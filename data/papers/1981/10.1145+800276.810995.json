  "abstract": "This session described how CONFER, a computer-based conferencing system at the University of Michigan, was developed with participation of users, and what impact the system has on communities of users. At this conference it may be especially interesting to discuss various ways in which help provided to new users has evolved. Some extrapolations may be made for other than electronic communication aids: orientation and training, on-line reference information, on-line consultation, etc.",
