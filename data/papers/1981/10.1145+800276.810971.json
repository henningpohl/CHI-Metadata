  "abstract": "The office of the future is defined. It is a work station\ndominated by a micro computer which is in communication with more\npowerful computers, large disks, printers, and other equipment\nwhich can be shared. The large computers, disks, printers, and all\nthe rest already exist. Micro Computers or desk top computers\nalready exist. There are only two steps left in realizing the\noffice of the future. One step involves electronics; establishing\nhigh speed communication between the desk top computer and all of\nthe other equipment. The second involves programming; defining and\ndeveloping coherent software systems. This paper is about the way\nin which these two problems were handled by the department of\npolitical science at the university of Iowa.\nWeeg Computing Center provides academic computing services for\nthe University of Iowa. They do this with a collection of\ncomputers; there is an I.B.M. 370, 5 Prime 750s, 4 Hewlett Packard\n2000s, and a Vax. There are also disks, plotters, printers, and the\nwhole panoply of equipment one expects in a university computing\nenvironment. In addition, a Gandalf communication system makes it\npossible to access any one of these computers at speeds up to 2400\nbits per second. These facilities are normally accessed with the\naid of one of the approximately 750 terminals on campus. With the\nsupport of Weeg computing Center the department of political\nscience convinced the university administration that it would be\nworthwhile experimenting with desk top computers for an entire\ndepartment. Money was made available, and 37 computers were\npurchased. Which brought us to the two problems: high speed (in\nthis case 2400 bits per second) communication; and a coherent\nsystem of programs.\nCommodore 8032s were purchased, and this meant that we needed an\ninterface which would translate into the serial signal the Gandalf\nsystem used. Several interfaces were available commercially, but we\ncould not make any of them work at 2400 bits per second. Nor could\nwe get the terminal emulator programs available commercially to\nprint the screen at 2400 bits per second. The dominant speed in\nmicro to larger computer communication is 300 b.p.s., fast means\n1200 bits per second. An interface board was designed by the\nelectronics shop at the University for us, and a machine language\nprogram was written which would handle sending and receiving at the\nrequisite speed. In principle this seemed a straightforward task.\nIn practice there was a stream of nitty gritty problems that seemed\nas though it would go on forever. But it was done.\nThree design considerations dominated the creation of the\nsoftware system. One, it had to be as simple to use as possible.\nHalf of the potential users had never used a computer before. That\nimplied that the system must be as automatic as possible. Two, it\nhad to, initially, provide a terminal to each user plus handle word\nprocessing and electronic mail for the department. Three, it had to\nallocate tasks between the desk top computers and the Weeg supplied\ncomputers in a way that, within reasonable bounds, maximized the\nwork done on the desk top computers and minimized use of central\nresources.\nTwo features of the system illustrate our attempt to make it as\neasy to use as possible. First, signing on to the central computer\nis almost automatic. Each person's copy of the machine language\nprogram contains their four codes required to sign on to the\nsystem. The individual can send these codes by pressing the control\nkey and the up arrow or programs developed for this system will\nautomatically send these codes. Signing off is equally automatic.\nWhen the Prime on the other end has finished sending or receiving a\nprogram or data it automatically signs off. Second, all choices are\nmade from two lists. One list is on the Prime, and the other list\nis embedded in the software used on the CBM 8032. Physical\ncontiguity of choices reduces the amount of recall necessary to use\nthe system.\nA good screen based text editing program enhances one's ability\nto put words together. It does this by making it easy to write and\nrevise. However, there are many tasks, in addition to writing and\nrevising, that one needs to be able to carry out with the document\nbeing written. You must be able to save and recall the text. It is\nvery nice to be able to append a second file to the one being\nwritten. It is very nice to be able to save a segment of the file\nbeing written. And the text must be sent to be printed. All of\nthese operations can be performed with the aid of the list of\ncommands in the text editing program. One presses 's' and gives a\nfile name; the programs do the rest. In addition, one would like to\nbe able to look at a list of files that have been created and\nsaved, delete files that are no longer needed, transfer a file to\nthe disk storage area of a collaborator for his or her review, send\na file (program or program control information) to the batch\nprocessing system, and send a file directly from the disk to be\nprinted. All of these tasks can be performed using the list of\ncommands on the Prime. Most of the operations one can imagine\nwanting to perform on a text file can be accomplished with one of\nthe two lists. That makes the system easy to learn; it provides\ncoherence.\nIn this system the Prime serves as the storage device and the\nmedium of communication. Programs and text files are stored on the\nPrime disk; there are no disks for the desk top computers. In\naddition, sending a file to be printed or sending a file to a\ncollaborator plus electronic mail are handled by the Prime. The\ndesk top computers handle the writing and revising which is done\nwith a program written in BASIC to run on these computers. Since\nwriting is an exceedingly important part of the job of academics\nthe computers are on all the time. But most of the time they are\nnot on to the central computing resources; they are working as\nstand alone computers.\nWhen you walk up and down the hall in the department of\npolitical science you see lots of computers going. Writing has\nbecome much easier. And getting a final document produced has never\nbeen as easy or as fast. The mini-micro connection works.",
