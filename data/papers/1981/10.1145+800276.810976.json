  "abstract": "Providing mechanisms for inexperienced users of computer systems to program the computer to repetitively perform tasks that the user normally does in his or her daily job is one of the most challenging tasks for designers of highly interactive computer systems oriented to naive users. This report presents early results of a study conducted to ascertain the written analogues of the programming structures iteration, conditional and variables. The study required users already familiar with office procedures to practice a routine forms fill-in and data verification task over a period of one week. At the end of that time, they were required to write a set of procedures as if they were instructing a new person in the performance of the job. These written protocols (in conjunction with verbal protocols taken during the learning phase) were analyzed in terms of the above-mentioned structures.It was found that a variety of structures are used by naive users, but more importantly, all users made serious errors of both omission and commission. In particular, events of low probability were not described at all. In certain cases the written instructions did not correspond with the way in which users actually performed the tasks.The implications for office systems designers, amongst others, are explored.",
