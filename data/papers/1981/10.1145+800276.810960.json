  "abstract": "An argument is made for the systematic collection and analysis of data regarding user-computer interaction in an on-line setting. A suggested approach involving preliminary data collection/analysis, development of a conceptual framework or model, and validation of the model is described. The case for this approach is supported by presentation of some preliminary results from a study of monitor data collected from the National Library of Medicine's ELHILL transaction file. Follow-on steps are proposed including comparison of research results to other studies of the same system or studies using similar techniques.",
