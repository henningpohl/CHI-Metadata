  "abstract": "The present keyboard arrangement cannot be defended as comfortable, logically arranged, or optimized for human efficiency. Information theory based experiments suggest measures for alternative arrangements. Character sets used in different tasks can be expected to yield different optimal key locations. New tasks are introducing new characters and changing the frequency of selected old ones. Numerous alternative arrangements for alphanumeric fingered entry have been designed, but none are supported by conclusive testing. The amateur keyboard user far outnumbers the professional. Computer entry and word-processors are overtaking the simple typewriter as common alphanumeric stroke entry devices. Compromise and selection of a simplified keyboard that is compatible with present mechanical and electronic designs is advocated.",
