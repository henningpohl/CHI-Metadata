  "abstract": "Controlling the privacy of online content is difficult and often confusing. We present a social access control where users devise simple questions testing shared knowledge instead of constructing authenticated accounts and explicit access control rules. We implemented a prototype and conducted studies to explore the context of photo sharing security, gauge the difficulty of creating shared knowledge questions, measure their resilience to adversarial attack, and evaluate user ability to understand and predict this resilience.",
