  "abstract": "The focus of this work is the requirements engineering process in the home care domain. The overall aim is to design and document a flexible methodology to facilitate the elicitation of complex, dynamic, multi-stakeholder requirements and needs. This paper details the complexity and uniqueness of the home care domain and outlines the features of home care that demand a new or tailored approach to requirements engineering. It concludes by presenting a consolidated list of features that must be available or supported in requirements engineering methods in the home care domain.",
