  "abstract": "To understand how and why individuals make use of emerging information assimilation services on the Web as part of their daily routine, we combined video recordings of online activity with targeted interviews of eleven experienced web users. From these observations, we describe their choice of systems, the goals they are trying to achieve, their information diets, the basic process they use for assimilating information, and the impact of user interface speed.",
