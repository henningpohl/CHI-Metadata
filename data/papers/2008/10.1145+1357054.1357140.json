  "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the design of the ear tracker. The ear tracker detects the direction to which a person is listening. We propose the technique as a new form of an input device technology, which potentially allows the user to control machines with vague intention rather than explicit commands. Our ear tracker makes the detection with the electromyogram (EMG) signals probed behind ears. We have prototyped its hardware and algorithm. In our experiment, it shows 70% accuracy for detecting whether the testee is listening to the left or right.",
