  "abstract": "We developed four widely different interfaces for users of\nSomewire, a prototype audio-only media space. We informally studied\nusers experiences with the two screen- based interfaces. We\nprototyped a non-screen-based interface as an example of a novel\ntangible interface for a communication system. We explored the\nconflict between privacy and simplicity of representation, and\nidentified two unresolved topics: the role of audio quality and the\nprospects for scsiling audio spaces beyond a single Workgroup.\nFinally, we formulated a set of design guidelines for control and\nrepresentation in audio spaces, as follows: GUIs are not\nwell-suited to audio spaces, users do not require control over\nlocalization or other audio attributes, and awareness of other\nusers presence is desirable.",
