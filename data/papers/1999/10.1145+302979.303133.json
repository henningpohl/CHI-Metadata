  "abstract": "Choosing input devices for interactive systems that best suit\nusers needs remains a challenge, especially consid- ering the\nincreasing number of devices available. The choice often has to be\nmade through empirical evalua- tions. The most frequently used\nevaluation task hitherto is target acquisition, a task that can be\naccurately modeled by Fitts law. However, todays use of computer\ninput devices has gone beyond target acquisition alone. In\nparticular, we often need to perform trajectory-based tasks, such\nas drawing, writing, and navigation. This paper illustrates how a\nrecently discovered model, the steering law, can be applied as an\nevaluation paradigm complementary to Fitts law. We tested five\ncommonly used computer input devices in two steering tasks, one\nlinear and one circular. Results showed that subjects performance\nwith the five devices could be generally classified into three\ngroups in the following order: 1. the tablet and the mouse, 2. the\ntrackpoint, 3. the touch- pad and the trackball. The steering law\nproved to hold for all five devices with greater than 0.98\ncorrelation. The ability to generalize the experimental results and\nthe limitations of the steering law are also discussed.",
