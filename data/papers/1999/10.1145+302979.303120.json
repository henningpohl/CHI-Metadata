  "abstract": "This research presents cognitive models of a person selecting an\nitem from a familiar, ordered, pull-down menu. Two different models\nprovide a good fit with human data and thus two different possible\nexplanations for the low- level cognitive processes involved in the\ntask. Both models assert that people make an initial eye and hand\nmovement to an anticipated target location without waiting for the\nmenu to appear. The first model asserts that a person knows the\nexact location of the target item before the menu appears, but the\nmodel uses nonstandard Fitts law coefficients to predict mouse\npointing time. The second model asserts that a person would only\nknow the approximate location of the target item, and the model\nuses Fitts law coefficients better supported by the literature.\nThis research demonstrates that people can develop considerable\nknowledge of locations in a visual task environment, and that more\nwork regarding Fitts law is needed.",
