  "abstract": "The Palette is a digital appliance designed for intuitive\ncontrol of electronic slide shows. Current interfaces demand too\nmuch of our attention to permit effective computer use in\nsituations where we can not give the technology our fullest\nconcentration. The Palette uses index cards that are printed with\nslide content that is easily identified by both humans and\ncomputers. The presenter controls the presentation by directly\nmanipulating the cards. The Palette design is based on our\nobservation of presentations given in a real work setting. Our\nexperiences using the system are described, including new practices\n(e.g., collaborative presentation, enhanced notetaking) that arise\nfrom the affordances of this new approach. This system is an\nexample of a new interaction paradigm called tacit\ninteraction that supports users who can spare very little\nattention to a computer interface.",
