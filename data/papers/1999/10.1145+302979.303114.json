  "abstract": "We introduce a system for urban planning - called Urp -that\nintegrates functions addressing a broad range of the fields\nconcerns into a single, physically based workbench setting. The I/O\nBulb infrastructure on which the application is based allows\nphysical architectural models placed on an ordinary table surface\nto cast shadows accurate for arbitrary times of day; to throw\nreflections off glass facade surfaces; to affect a real-time and\nvisually coincident simulation of pedestrian-level windflow; and so\non.\nWe then use comparisons among Urp and several\nearlier I/O Bulb applications as the basis for an\nunderstanding of luminous-tangible interactions, which result\nwhenever an interface distributes meaning and functionality between\nphysical objects and visual information projectively coupled to\nthose objects. Finally, we briefly discuss two issues common to all\nsuch systems, offering them as informal thought-tools for the\ndesign and analysis of luminous-tangible interfaces.",
