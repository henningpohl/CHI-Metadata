  "abstract": "This paper describes a research study that investigated how\ndesigners can use frames of reference (egocentric, exocentric, and\na combination of the two) to support the mastery of abstract\nmultidimensional information. The primary focus of this study was\nthe relationship between FORs and mastery; the secondary focus was\non other factors (individual characteristics and interaction\nexperience) that were likely to influence the relationship between\nFORs and mastery. This studys outcomes (1) clarify how FORs work in\nconjunction with other factors in shaping mastery, (2) highlight\nstrengths and weaknesses of different FORs, (3) demonstrate the\nbenefits of providing multiple FORs, and (4) provide the basis for\nour recommendations to HCI researchers and designers.",
