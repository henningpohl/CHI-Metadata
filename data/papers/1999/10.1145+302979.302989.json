  "abstract": "An experiment was conducted to systematically investigate\ncombined effects of controller, cursor and target size on\nmultidimensional object manipulation in a virtual environment. It\nwas found that it was the relative size of controller, cursor and\ntarget that significantly affe&d object transportation and\norientation processes. There were significant interactions between\ncontroller size and cursor size as well as between cursor size and\ntarget size on the total task completion time, transportation time,\norientation time and spatial errors. The same size of controller\nand cursor improved object manipulation speed, and the same size of\ncursor and target generally facilitated object manipulation\naccuracy, regardless of their absolute sizes. Implications of these\nfindings for human-computer interaction design are discussed.",
