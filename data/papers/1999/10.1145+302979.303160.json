  "abstract": "A study was conducted to evaluate user performance and\nsatisfaction in completion of a set of text creation tasks using\nthree commercially available continuous speech recognition systems.\nThe study also compared user performance on similar tasks using\nkeyboard input. One part of the study (Initial Use) involved 24\nusers who enrolled, received training and carried out practice\ntasks, and then completed a set of transcription and composition\ntasks in a single session. In a parallel effort (Extended Use),\nfour researchers used speech recognition to carry out real work\ntasks over 10 sessions with each of the three speech recognition\nsoftware products. This paper presents results from the Initial Use\nphase of the study along with some preliminary results from the\nExtended Use phase. We present details of the kinds of usability\nand system design problems likely in current systems and several\ncommon patterns of error correction that we found.",
