  "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss why, in designing multiparty mediated\nsystems, we should focus first on providing non-verbal cues which\nare less redundantly coded in speech than those normally conveyed\nby video. We show how conveying one such cue, gaze direction, may\nsolve two problems in multiparty mediated communication and\ncollaboration: knowing who is talking to whom, and who is talking\nabout what. As a candidate solution, we present the GAZE Groupware\nSystem, which combines support for gaze awareness in multiparty\nmediated communication and collaboration with small and linear\nbandwidth requirements. The system uses an advanced, desk- mounted\neyetracker to metaphorically convey gaze awareness in a 3D virtual\nmeeting room and within shared documents.",
