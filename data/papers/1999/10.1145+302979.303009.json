  "abstract": "Whisper is a new wrist-worn handset, which is used by inserting\nthe fingertip into the ear canal. A received signal is conveyed\nfrom a wrist-mounted actuator to the ear canal via the hand and a\nfinger by bone conduction. The users voice is captured by a\nmicrophone mounted on the inside of the wrist. All components of\nWhisper can be mounted on the wrist, and usability does not de-\ncrease if the size of components is miniaturized. So, both\nwearability and usability can be achieved together. The way Whisper\nis operated is similar to that of an ordinary telephone handset.\nThus, onlookers may not look upon Whispers operation as talking to\noneself, even if the associated PDA is controlled by voice\ncommands. Whis- per is especially effective in a noisy environment.\nSignals received via bone conduction can be heard clearly in the\npresence of noise without raising the volume (-12 dB at noise = 90\ndB(A) in comparison to cellular phone hand- set). Whisper is also\neffective in avoiding the annoying problem of the users voice being\nraised in a noisy situa- tion. Feedback of the users utterance is\nboosted by bone conduction when covering the ear canal with a\nfingertip, then the users voice does not need to raised in the\npres- ence of noise (-6 dB at noise = 90 dB(A) in comparison to\ncellular phone handset). Whisper is useful as a voice interface for\na wrist-worn PDA and cellular phone.",
