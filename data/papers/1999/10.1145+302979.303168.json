  "abstract": "As a part of a European Union sponsored project, we have\nproposed a system which aggregates peoples expressions over a\nwidening network of public electronic displays in a massive Dutch\nhousing development. Reflecting ideas from contemporary arts as\nwell as from research on media spaces, this is an example of a\nconceptual design intended to produce meaningful effects on a local\nculture. In this paper, we describe the methods and ideas that led\nto this proposal, as an example of research on technologies from\nthe traditions of artist-designers.",
