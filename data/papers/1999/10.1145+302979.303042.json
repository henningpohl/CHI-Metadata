  "abstract": "The IS0 9241, Part 9 Draft International Standard for testing\ncomputer pointing devices proposes an evaluation of performance and\ncomfort. In this paper we evaluate the scientific validity and\npracticality of these dimensions for two pointing devices for\nlaptop computers, a finger-controlled isometric joystick and a\ntouchpad. Using a between-subjects design, evaluation of\nperformance using the measure of throughput was done for\none-direction and multi-directional pointing and selecting. Results\nshow a significant difference in throughput for the\nmulti-directional task, with the joystick 27% higher; results for\nthe one-direction task were non-significant. After the experiment,\nparticipants rated the device for comfort, including operation,\nfatigue, and usability. The questionnaire showed no overall\ndifference in the responses, and a significant statistical\ndifference in only the question concerning force required to\noperate the device - the joystick requiring slightly more force.\nThe paper concludes with a discussion of problems in implementing\nthe IS0 standard and recommendations for improvement.",
