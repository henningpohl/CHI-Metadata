  "abstract": "Current object-oriented drawing programs have an established way\nof drawing in which the shape of an object is controlled by\nmanipulating control points. While the control points are intuitive\nin their basic use, it is not clear whether they make more complex\ndrawing tasks manageable for the average user. In this paper we\ndescribe an alternative way of drawing and editing a drawing using\nnew direct manipulation tools. Our approach resembles sculpting in\ntwo dimensions: the user begins with a large block and uses\ndifferent tools to give it the desired shape. We also present a\nuser evaluation in which the users could try our new tools and\ncompare them to their previous experience of control points, The\nusers claimed to understand the operations better with our tools\nthan if they had needed to use curves and control points. However,\nour tools were better suited for sketching the artwork than for\nmaking very detailed drawings.",
