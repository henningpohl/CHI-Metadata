  "abstract": "This paper reports on Direct Combination, a new user interaction\ntechnique. Direct Combination may be viewed variously as: a\nsystematic extension to Direct Manipulation; a concise navigational\nframework to help users find the operations they need; and as a\nframework to make a greater range and variety of operations\navailable to the user, without overburdening user or interface\ndesigner. While Direct Combination may be seen as an extension of\nDirect Manipulation, it may also be applied to a wide range of user\ninteraction styles, including even command line interfaces.\nExamples from various hypothetical systems and from an implemented\nsystem are presented. This paper argues that Direct Combination is\napplicable not just to problem seeking or design oriented domains\n(where the technique originated) but is generally applicable. A\nvariety of new interaction styles for Direct Combination are\npresented. The generalisation of Direct Combination to the\nn-dimensional case is presented.",
