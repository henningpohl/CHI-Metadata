  "abstract": "Given the importance of credibility in computing products, the\nresearch on computer credibility is relatively small. To enhance\nknowledge about computers and credibility, we define key terms\nrelating to computer credibility, synthesize the literature in this\ndomain, and propose three new conceptual frameworks for better\nunderstanding the elements of computer credibility. To promote\nfurther research, we then offer two perspectives on what computer\nusers evaluate when assessing credibility. We conclude by\npresenting a set of credibility-related terms that can serve in\nfuture research and evaluation endeavors.",
