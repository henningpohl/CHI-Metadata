  "abstract": "Interest in pen-based user interfaces is growing rapidly. One\npotentially useful feature of pen-based user interfaces is\ngestures, that is, a mark or stroke that causes a command to\nexecute. Unfortunately, it is difficult to design gestures that are\neasy 1) for computers to recognize and 2) for humans to learn and\nremember. To investigate these problems, we built a prototype tool\ntypical fo those used for designing gesture sets. An experiment was\nthen performed to gain insight into the gesture design process and\nto evaluate this style of tool. The experiment confirmed that\ngesture design is very difficult and suggested several ways in\nwhich current tools can be improved. The most important improvement\nis to make the tools more active and provide more guidance for\ndesigners. This paper describes the gesture design tool, the\nexperiment, and its results.",
