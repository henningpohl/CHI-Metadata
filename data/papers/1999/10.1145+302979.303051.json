  "abstract": "Human interfaces are usually designed to respond only to\nintentional human behaviors. However, humans show unintentional\nbehaviors as well. They can convey useful information to realize\nuser-friendly human interfaces. This paper presents how to combine\nobservations of both types of behaviors by taking two human-\nmachine systems: a gesture-based interface and an intelligent\nwheelchair. In the first system, intentional hand gestures are\nchosen using unintentional behaviors. In the second system, near\nunintentional behaviors following intentional behaviors can be used\nto control the wheelchair motion. Experimental systems working in\nreal time have been developed. Operational experiments prove our\napproach promising.",
