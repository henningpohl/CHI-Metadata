  "abstract": "We are exploring a new class of tools for learners: scaffolded\nintegrated tool environments (or SITES), which address the needs of\nlearners trying to engage in new, complex work processes. A crucial\nphase within a learner-centered design approach for SITE design\ninvolves analyzing the work process to identify areas where\nlearners need support to engage in the process. Here we discuss the\ndesign of Symphony, a SITE for high-school science students.\nSpecifically, we discuss how the process-space model helped us\nanalyze the science inquiry process to help us identify a detailed\nset of learner needs, leading to a full set of process scaffolding\nstrategies for Symphony.",
