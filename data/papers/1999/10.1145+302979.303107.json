  "abstract": "NotePals is a lightweight note sharing system that gives group\nmembers easy access to each others experiences through their\npersonal notes. The system allows notes taken by group members in\nany context to be uploaded to a shared repository. Group members\nview these notes with browsers that allow them to retrieve all\nnotes taken in a given context or to access notes from other\nrelated notes or documents. This is possible because NotePals\nrecords the context in which each note is created (e.g., its\nauthor, subject, and creation time). The system is lightweight\nbecause it fits easily into group members regular note- taking\npractices, and uses informal, ink-based user interfaces that run on\nportable, inexpensive hardware. In this paper we describe NotePals,\nshow how we have used it to share our notes, and present our\nevaluations of the system.",
