  "abstract": "Topic management is the task of gathering, evaluating,\norganizing, and sharing a set of web sites for a specific topic.\nCurrent web tools do not provide adequate support for this task. We\ncreated the TopicShop system to address this need. TopicShop\nincludes (1) a webcrawler that discovers relevant web sites and\nbuilds site profiles, and (2) user interfaces for exploring and\norganizing sites. We conducted an empirical study comparing user\nperformance with TopicShop vs. YahooTM. TopicShop subjects found\nover 80% more high-quality sites (where quality was determined by\nindependent expert judgements) while browsing only 8 1% as many\nsites and completing their task in 89% of the time. The site\nprofile data that TopicShop provides - in particular, the number of\npages on a site and the number of other sites that link to it - was\nthe key to these results, as users exploited it to identify the\nmost promising sites quickly and easily.",
