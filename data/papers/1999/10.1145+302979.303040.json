  "abstract": "Should programming languages use natural-language-like syntax?\nUnder what circumstances? What sorts of errors do novice\nprogrammers make? Does using a natural- language-like programming\nlanguage lead to user errors? In this study, we read the entire\nonline interactions of sixteen children who issued a total of\n35,047 commands on MOOSE Crossing, an educational MUD for children,\nWe counted and categorized the errors made. A total d 2,970 errors\nwere observed. We define natural-language errors as those errors in\nwhich the user failed to distinguish between English and code,\nissuing an incorrect command that was more English-like than the\ncorrect one. A total of 314 natural-language errors were observed.\nIn most of those errors, the child was able to correct the problem\neither easily (41.1% of the time) or with some effort (20.7%).\nNatural-language errors were divided into five categories. In order\nfrom most to least frequent, they are: syntax errors, guessing a\ncommand name by supplying an arbitrary English word, literal\ninterpretation of metaphor, assuming the system is keeping more\nstate information than is actually the case, and errors of operator\nprecedence and combination. We believe that these error rates are\nwithin acceptable limits, and conclude that leveraging users\nnatural-language knowledge is for many applications an effective\nstrategy for designing end-user-programming languages.",
