  "abstract": "The design and evaluation of a high performance soft keyboard\nfor mobile systems are described. Using a model to predict the\nupper-bound text entry rate for soft keyboards, we designed a\nkeyboard layout with a predicted upper-bound entry rate of 58.2\nwpm. This is about 35% faster than the predicted rate for a QWERTY\nlayout. We compared our design (OPTI) with a QWERTY layout in a\nlongitudinal evaluation using five participants and 20 45-minute\nsessions of text entry. Average entry rates for OPT1 increased from\n17.0 wpm initially to 44.3 wpm at session 20. The average rates\nexceeded those for the QWERTY layout after the 10 session (about 4\nhours of practice). A regression equation (R = .997) in the form of\nthe power-law of learning predicts that our upper-bound prediction\nwould be reach at about session 50.",
