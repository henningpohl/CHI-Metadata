  "abstract": "A common medium for advertising on the Internet is the use of banner ads. This study investigates recall and recognition of animated banner advertisements in an attempt to identify design guidelines. It was hypothesized that animation would increase recall and recognition of novel ads by increasing user awareness. No significant relationships were found between the use of animation and ability to recall and recognize banner ads. Results indicate that animation does not enhance user memory of online banner advertisements.",
