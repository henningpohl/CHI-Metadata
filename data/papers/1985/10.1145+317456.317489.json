  "abstract": "ADM is a system for developing user interfaces. We call it a dialog manager; it is similar to what others call a \u201cUser Interface Management System\u201d [8]. Although ADM is still being developed, it has been used to construct several applications.A dialog manager divides an application into an \u201cinteraction handler,\u201d which interacts with the user, and an \u201cunderlying application,\u201d which processes user commands and data. With ADM the application designer writes the underlying application in a conventional programming language and defines the interface between interaction handler and underlying application in terms of \u201ctasks,\u201d things the user can do, and \u201cstates,\u201d sets of tasks that are active at one time. The user interface designer defines the interaction handler in terms of \u201cpresentation techniques,\u201d which present tasks to the user, and \u201cstructuring techniques,\u201d which describe screen layout. Design decisions made for ADM include using a precompiled, declarative dialog description, a flexible division between interaction handler and underlying application, allowing either interaction handler or underlying application to maintain control, and the inclusion of help and error support.",
