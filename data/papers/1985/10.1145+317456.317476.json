  "abstract": "In the development of a new interactive graphics application, considerable effort was spent on designing a user interface which would be easy to use. When a portion of the application was completed, typical potential users were brought in to help evaluate the interface. They were given a sample task and a short introduction to the application; then their efforts to complete the task were observed and videotaped.This method of evaluating the user interface provided the development staff with quite a bit of valuable information. Changes were made, and more testing was done, including using some subjects for a second time.This paper describes how this evaluation method was used for two purposes: to point out problem areas in the interface, and to verify that changes made have improved the user interface.",
