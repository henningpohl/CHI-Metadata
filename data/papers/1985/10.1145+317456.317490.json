  "abstract": "Performance and subjective reactions of 76 users of varying levels of computer experience were measured with 7 different interfaces representing command, menu, and iconic interface styles. The results suggest three general conclusions:there are large usability differences between contemporary systems,there is no necessary tradeoff between ease of use and ease of learning,interface style is not related to performance or preference (but careful design is).Difficulties involving system feedback, input forms, help systems, and navigation aids occurred in all styles of interface: command, menu, and iconic. New interface technology did not solve old human factors problems.",
