  "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach to the characterization of complexity within computer software source texts. We estimate the information content of individual program tokens as the basis for a relative ordering of tokens by their 'uncertainty' or 'perculiarity' within the context of the program in which they reside. The analysis method used is in part an extension of software science methods. The information gained from the analysis highlights language usage anomalies and potential errors. This information may be useful in guiding software review activities.More theoretical work and experimental validation will be necessary before the analysis technique may be used in a productive environment.",
