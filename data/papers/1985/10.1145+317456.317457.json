  "abstract": "The effect of video display unit presentation rate on reading performance was investigated. Reading material was presented at one of the following presentation-rates: 15, 30, 120, 960 cps, or \u201cinstant\u201d. In the instant condition, the full text appeared simultaneously on the screen. In the other conditions, text appeared one character at a time starting in the upper left corner of the screen, from left to right and top to bottom. Reading comprehension was highest under the 30 cps and instant presentation conditions. Total time to perform the reading task was equivalent for all conditions except the 15 cps rate which required a longer time to complete the task. In terms of comprehension and time to perform the task, a slow rate of 15 cps, contrary to previous recommendations, is not desirable for novice computer users.",
