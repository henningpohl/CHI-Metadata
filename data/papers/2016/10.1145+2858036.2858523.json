  "abstract": "User Experience (UX) research teams following a user centered design approach harness personas to better understand a user's workflow by examining that user's behavior, goals, needs, wants, and frustrations. To create target personas these researchers rely on workflow data from surveys, self-reports, interviews, and user observation. However, this data not directly related to user behavior, weakly reflects a user's actual workflow in the product, is costly to collect, is limited to a few hundred responses, and is outdated as soon as a persona's workflows evolve. To address these limitations we present a quantitative bottom-up data-driven approach to create personas. First, we directly incorporate user behavior via clicks gathered automatically from telemetry data related to the actual product use in the field; since the data collection is automatic it is also cost effective. Next, we aggregate 3.5 million clicks from 2400 users into 39,000 clickstreams and then structure them into 10 workflows via hierarchical clustering; we thus base our personas on a large data sample. Finally, we use mixed models, a statistical approach that incorporates these clustered workflows to create five representative personas; updating our mixed model ensures that these personas remain current. We also validated these personas with our product's user behavior experts to ensure that workflows and the persona goals represent actual product use.",
