  "abstract": "We present a photo co-creation activity, called \"Stitched Groupies,\" in a photo-taking and sharing platform deployed inside IBM. \"Stitched Groupies\" allow employees to take and combine photos with peers asynchronously across physical boundaries. In a 25-day exploratory field study with 50 users taking 68 half-photos (of which 52 were completed by others), we categorized themes such as Spliced Faces, Composed Scenes, Body Modifications, Inanimate Objects and Doppelgangers. Our results suggest that photo co-creation can stimulate playfulness and fun in the workplace.",
