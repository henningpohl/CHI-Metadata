  "abstract": "A critical aspect of formal help-giving tasks in the enterprise is finding the right expert. We built and evaluated a tool, Find an Expert, to examine what the most important expert selection criteria are for help-seekers and how to represent them in expert selection interfaces for formal help-giving tasks. We observed users' expert selection decisions and found that the diversity of topic expertise and the amount of related experience were significantly important in helping users decide which expert to contact. Through self-reported data from users, we found that in addition to expertise and experience, expert accessibility indicators, like online availability and language proficiency, were considered important criteria for selecting experts. Finally, publicly-displayed crowdsourced ratings of experts, while deemed useful indicators of expert quality by help-seekers, raised concerns for experts. We conclude with suggestions regarding the design of expert selection interfaces for formal help-giving tasks.",
