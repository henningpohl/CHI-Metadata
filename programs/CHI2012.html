An ameliorative discipline of both theory and practice, somaesthetics seeks to enrich not only our discursive knowledge of the body but also our lived somatic experience and performance; it aims to improve the meaning, understanding, efficacy, and beauty of our movements and of the environments to which our actions contribute and from which they also derive their energies and significance. To pursue these aims, somaesthetics is concerned with a wide diversity of knowledge forms and discourses, social practices and institutions, cultural traditions, values, and bodily disciplines that structure (or could improve) such somatic understanding and cultivation. As an interdisciplinary project that is not confined to one dominant academic field, professional vocabulary, cultural ideology, or particular set of bodily disciplines, somaesthetics aims to provide an overarching theoretical structure and a set of basic and versatile conceptual tools to enable a more fruitful interaction and integration of the very diverse forms of somatic knowledge currently being practiced and pursued. My talk at CHI will present the fundamental principles of the somaesthetic, examine some of its interdisciplinary impact and then explore its possible applications to the field of interactive design. <br /> <br />BIO: Richard Shusterman is the Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities at Florida Atlantic University, where he is also Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Center for Body, Mind, and Culture: http://www.fau.edu/bodymindculture/. His primary research focus is the field of somaesthetics, which evolved in the late nineties from his work in pragmatist philosophy and aesthetics. Author of Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics (Cambridge University Press, 2008), Shusterman has also written Surface and Depth (2002); Performing Live (2000); Practicing Philosophy (1997); Sous l&#8217;interpr&#233;tation (1994), Soma-esth&#233;tique et architecture: une alternative critique (2010), and Pragmatist Aesthetics (1992, 2000, and translated into fourteen languages). Formerly chair of the Philosophy Department of Temple University (Philadelphia), he has held academic appointments in France, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Japan, and has been awarded research grants from the NEH, Fulbright, ACLS, Humboldt Foundation, and UNESCO. In 2008 the French government awarded him the rank of Chevalier in the Order of Academic Palms for his cultural contributions. His exploratory research in somaesthetics is informed by his professional practice as a somatic educator and therapist in the Feldenkrais Method.</span></div></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S9_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Brad A.

This is particularly critical now in the US. Many of these prototype product ideas are quite good, but never see the light of day. At different times and within alternate companies they later become excellent products. There are many factors that contribute to good ideas apparently 'failing' to be released. Rarely are there papers or discussions held to dissect what factors led to their apparent rejection. Companies often repeat innovation mistakes, without benefitting from the hindsight from others. I will illustrate many media based products I have been involved with and were left on the shelf, only to come to life later. Although innovative enough, I will share the insights that probably led them not to come to market. <br /> <br />BIO: S. Joy Mountford is currently a consultant to eBay on the future of ecommerce.

These projected hints guide the user in completing the desired motion with their body part which is particularly useful for performing movements that require accuracy and proper technique, such as during exercise or physical therapy. Our proof-of-concept implementation consists of a single low-cost depth camera and projector and we present four novel interaction techniques that are focused on guiding a user&#65533;s hand in mid-air. Our visualizations are designed to incorporate both feedback and feedforward cues to help guide users through a range of movements. We quantify the performance of LightGuide in a user study comparing each of our on-body visualizations to hand animation videos on a computer display in both time and accuracy. Exceeding our expectations, participants performed movements with an average error of 21.6mm, nearly 85% more accurately than when guided by video.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207702">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper209"><a class="title" href="Session118.html#paper209">Understanding Flicking on Curved Surfaces</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Simon_Voelker">Simon Voelker</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Christine_Sutter">Christine Sutter</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Lei_Wang">Lei Wang</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jan_Borchers">Jan Borchers</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This paper investigates flicking gestures on curved interactive surfaces.

Errors in both stages could influence flicking accuracy. We investigated flicking interactions on curved interactive surface to evaluate which type of error influences accuracy. Therefore, we carried out three user studies to analyze how each stage of flicking on a curved surface is influenced. Our main findings are: 1)  Flicking gestures are more accurate if horizontal and vertical surface are joined by a continuous curve than if they are separated by an edge or gap. 2) Flicking gestures on curved surfaces are mostly influenced by the motor execution stage of the gesture rather than the visual perception stage. 3) Flicking accuracy decreases as the starting point of the gesture is moved closer to the curve. 4) We conclude with a first mathematical model to estimate the error users will make when flicking across a curve.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207703">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1700"><a class="title" href="Session118.html#paper1700">MirageTable: Freehand Interaction on a Projected Augmented Reality Tabletop</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Hrvoje_Benko">Hrvoje Benko</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ricardo_Jota">Ricardo Jota</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Inesc-ID">Inesc-ID, Portugal</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Andrew_D._Wilson">Andrew D.

Our depth camera tracks the user&#65533;s eyes and performs a real-time capture of both the shape and the appearance of any object placed in front of the camera (including user&#65533;s body and hands). This real-time capture enables perspective stereoscopic 3D visualizations to a single user that account for deformations caused by physical objects on the table. In addition, the user can interact with virtual objects through physically-realistic freehand actions without any gloves, trackers, or instruments. We illustrate these unique capabilities through three application examples: virtual 3D model creation, interactive gaming with real and virtual objects, and a 3D teleconferencing experience that not only presents a 3D view of a remote person, but also a seamless 3D shared task space. We also evaluated the user&#65533;s perception of projected 3D objects in our system, which confirmed that the users can correctly perceive such objects even when they are projected over different background colors and geometries (e.g., gaps, drops).</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207704">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper396"><a class="title" href="Session118.html#paper396">How Screen Transitions Influence Touch and Pointer Interaction Across Angled Display Arrangements</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Fabian_Hennecke">Fabian Hennecke</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Munich">University of Munich, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wolfgang_Matzke">Wolfgang Matzke</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Munich">University of Munich, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Andreas_Butz">Andreas Butz</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Munich">University of Munich, Germany</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>User study investigating the effects of screen transitions on touch and pointer interaction across angled display arrangements.

In a study participants performed dragging tasks across both display planes with direct touch as well as a pointing device. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant effect on task completion time. Only regarding accuracy the curved transition performed better than edge and bezel. Interestingly, the subjective judgment did generally not match the objective results.

We demonstrate the rich capabilities of Touch&#233; with five example setups from different application domains and conduct experimental studies that show gesture classification accuracies of 99% are achievable with our technology.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207743">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper818"><a class="title" href="Session119.html#paper818">Detecting Error-Related Negativity for Interaction Design</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/best.png" class="best" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chi_Vi">Chi Vi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sriram_Subramanian">Sriram Subramanian</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Demonstrate the capabilities of an off-the-shelf headset in detecting Error Related Negativity on a single trial basis.

ERN is triggered when a user either makes a mistake or the application behaves differently from their expectation. We first show that ERN can be seen on signals captured by EEG headsets like Emotiv&#65533; when doing a typical multiple choice reaction time (RT) task &#65533; Flanker task. We then present a single-trial online ERN algorithm that works by pre-computing the coefficient matrix of a logistic regression classifier using some data from a multiple choice reaction time task and uses it to classify incoming signals of that task on a single trial of data. We apply it to an interactive selection task that involved users selecting an object under time pressure. Furthermore the study was conducted in a typical office environment with ambient noise. Our results show that online single trial ERN detection is possible using off-the-shelf headsets during tasks that are typical of interactive applications. We then design a Superflick experiment with an integrated module mimicking an ERN detector to evaluate the accuracy of detecting ERN in the context of assisting users in interactive tasks. Based on these results we discuss and present several HCI scenarios for use of ERN.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207744">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper2022"><a class="title" href="Session119.html#paper2022">Implanted User Interfaces</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Christian_Holz">Christian Holz</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Hasso_Plattner_Institute">Hasso Plattner Institute, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tovi_Grossman">Tovi Grossman</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Autodesk_Research">Autodesk Research, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#George_Fitzmaurice">George Fitzmaurice</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Autodesk_Research">Autodesk Research, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Anne_Agur">Anne Agur</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Department_of_Anatomy,_University_of_Toronto">Department of Anatomy, University of Toronto, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We investigate the effect of skin on traditional components for sensing input, providing output, and for communicating, synchronizing and charging wirelessly.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> We investigate implanted user interfaces that small devices provide when implanted underneath human skin.

Results showed that the ambient temperature has a significant impact on people's ability to detect stimuli and also their perception of these stimuli.

Crowdsourcing offers an alternative approach in which an analyst pays workers to generate such explanations. Yet, asking workers with varying skills, backgrounds and motivations to simply "Explain why a chart is interesting" can result in irrelevant, unclear or speculative explanations of variable quality. To address these problems, we contribute seven strategies for improving the quality and diversity of worker-generated explanations. Our experiments show that using (S1) feature-oriented prompts, providing (S2) good examples, and including (S3) reference gathering, (S4) chart reading, and (S5) annotation subtasks increases the quality of responses by 28% for US workers and 196% for non-US workers. Feature-oriented prompts improve explanation quality by 69% to 236% depending on the prompt. We also show that (S6) pre-annotating charts can focus workers' attention on relevant details, and demonstrate that (S7) generating explanations iteratively increases explanation diversity without increasing worker attrition. We used our techniques to generate 910 explanations for 16 datasets, and found that 63% were of high quality. These results demonstrate that paid crowd workers can reliably generate diverse, high-quality explanations that support the analysis of specific datasets.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207709">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper256"><a class="title" href="Session117.html#paper256">Direct Answers for Search Queries in the Long Tail</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michael_S_Bernstein">Michael S Bernstein</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#MIT_CSAIL">MIT CSAIL, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jaime_Teevan">Jaime Teevan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Susan_Dumais">Susan Dumais</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Daniel_Liebling">Daniel Liebling</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eric_Horvitz">Eric Horvitz</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We introduce Tail Answers: a large collection of crowdsourced search results that are unpopular individually but together address a large proportion of search traffic.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Web search engines now offer more than ranked results.

To extend the reach of answers to thousands of new information needs, we introduce Tail Answers: a large collection of direct answers that are unpopular individually, but together address a large proportion of search traffic. These answers cover long-tail needs such as the average body temperature for a dog, substitutes for molasses, and the keyboard shortcut for a right-click. We introduce a combination of search log mining and paid crowdsourcing techniques to create Tail Answers. A user study with 361 participants suggests that Tail Answers significantly improved users' subjective ratings of search quality and their ability to solve needs without clicking through to a result.

We asked users to engage in sensemaking by organizing and annotating web search results into "knowledge maps," either with or without previous users' maps to work from. We also recorded gaze patterns as users examined others' knowledge maps.  Our findings show the conditions under which distributed sensemaking can improve sensemaking quality; that a user's sensemaking process is readily apparent to a subsequent user via a knowledge map; and that the organization of content was more useful to subsequent users than the content itself, especially when those users had differing goals.  We discuss the role distributed sensemaking can play in schema induction by helping users make a mental model of an information space and make recommendations for new tool and system development.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207711">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S43_details"><div class="submissionDetails" id="pl103"><a class="title" href="Session43.html#pl103">Women in UX Leadership in Business</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Panel</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Janaki_Kumar">Janaki Kumar</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#SAP_Labs">SAP Labs, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Dan_Rosenberg">Dan Rosenberg</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#SAP_Labs">SAP Labs, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Catherine_Courage">Catherine Courage</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Citrix_Systems">Citrix Systems, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Janice_A_Rohn">Janice A Rohn</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Experian">Experian, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Lisa_Kamm">Lisa Kamm</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Google,_Inc">Google, Inc, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Lisa_Anderson">Lisa Anderson</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft">Microsoft, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Christine_Holsberry">Christine Holsberry</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Facebook,_Inc">Facebook, Inc, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Apala_Lahiri_Chavan">Apala Lahiri Chavan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#human_factors_international,_india">human factors international, india, India</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>The goal of this panel is to launch a dialog on women in UX leadership in business.

This paper proposes the use of spatial memory in combination with hierarchy flattening as a means of improving GUI performance. We demonstrate these concepts through the design of a command selection interface, called CommandMaps, and analyse its theoretical performance characteristics. We then describe two studies evaluating CommandMaps against menus and Microsoft's Ribbon interface for both novice and experienced users. Results show that for novice users, there is no significant performance difference between CommandMaps and traditional interfaces -- but for experienced users, CommandMaps are significantly faster than both menus and the Ribbon.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207713">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper484"><a class="title" href="Session121.html#paper484">Improving Scrolling Devices with  Document Length Dependent Gain</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Andy_Cockburn">Andy Cockburn</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury, New Zealand</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Philip_Quinn">Philip Quinn</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury, New Zealand</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Carl_Gutwin">Carl Gutwin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Saskatchewan">University of Saskatchewan, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Stephen_Fitchett">Stephen Fitchett</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury, New Zealand</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a method for applying document-length-dependent gain to events reported by scrolling input devices such as scroll wheels.

A second experiment validates the method, showing that it allows faster scrolling in long and short documents than current scrolling-device gain methods, and that subjective preferences favour it.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207714">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1053"><a class="title" href="Session121.html#paper1053">Aural Browsing On-The-Go: Listening-based Back Navigation in Large Web Architectures</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tao_Yang">Tao Yang</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University">Indiana University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mexhid_Ferati">Mexhid Ferati</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University">Indiana University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Yikun_Liu">Yikun Liu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University">Indiana University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Romisa_Rohani_Ghahari">Romisa Rohani Ghahari</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University">Indiana University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Davide_Bolchini">Davide Bolchini</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University">Indiana University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Listening to a mobile site while on-the-go can be challenging. This paper introduces and evaluates topic- and list-based back, two strategies to enhance mobile navigation while aurally browsing the web.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Mobile web navigation requires highly-focused visual attention, which poses problems when it is inconvenient or distracting to continuously look at the screen (e.g., while walking). Aural interfaces support more eyes-free experiences, as users can primarily listen to the content and occasionally look at the device. Yet, designing aural information architectures remains a challenge. Specifically, back navigation is inefficient in the aural setting, as it forces users to listen to each previous page to retrieve the desired content. This paper introduces topic- and list-based back: two navigation strategies to enhance aural browsing. Both are manifest in Green-Savers Mobile (GSM), an aural mobile site. A study (N=29) compared both solutions to traditional back mechanisms. Our findings indicate that topic- and list-based back enable faster access to previous pages, improve the navigation experience and reduce perceived cognitive load. The proposed designs apply to a wide range of content-intensive, ubiquitous web systems.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207715">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper412"><a class="title" href="Session121.html#paper412">PolyZoom: Multiscale and Multifocus Exploration in 2D Visual Spaces</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Waqas_Javed">Waqas Javed</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Purdue_University">Purdue University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sohaib_Ghani">Sohaib Ghani</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Purdue_University">Purdue University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Niklas_Elmqvist">Niklas Elmqvist</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Purdue_University">Purdue University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We present PolyZoom, a navigation technique for 2D-multiscale visual spaces that allows users to build a hierarchy of focus regions, thereby maintaining awareness of multiple scales at the same time.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> The most common techniques for navigating in multiscale visual spaces are pan, zoom, and bird's eye views.

Our analysis provides insights into relationships between saliency, focused attention, and affect. Participants reported more distraction in the non-salient condition, and non-salient information was slower to find than salient. Lack-of-saliency led to a negative impact on affect, while saliency maintained positive affect, suggesting its helpfulness. Participants reported that it was easier to focus in the salient condition, although there was no significant improvement in the focused attention scale rating. Finally, this study suggests user interest in the topic is a good predictor of focused attention, which in turn is a good predictor of positive affect.

The method enables not only the quantification of arousing emotional states but also their disambiguation into positive or negative instances. The physiological channel targets sympathetic responses and is materialized as a perspiratory signal extracted from thermal imagery of the perinasal area. The observational channel is materialized via decoding of facial expressions. However, while such decoding is usually performed in the visible spectrum, the authors have developed an algorithm to carry this out in thermal imagery instead. Thus, thermal imaging is used for both physiological and observational analysis. The potential of this dual unobtrusive methodology is demonstrated with some examples from a stress study, where users (surgeons in this case) interact with laparoscopic training boxes.</span></div></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S123_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Mary Czerwinski, Microsoft Research, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper136"><a class="title" href="Session123.html#paper136">Intimacy in Long-Distance Relationships over Video Chat</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Carman_Neustaedter">Carman Neustaedter</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Simon_Fraser_University">Simon Fraser University, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Saul_Greenberg">Saul Greenberg</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Calgary">University of Calgary, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes an interview study of how couples in long distance relationships use video chat systems for shared living and intimacy over distance.

This includes a large number of dating college students as well as couples who are geographically-separated because of situational demands such as work. We conducted interviews with individuals in LDRs to understand how they make use of video chat systems to maintain their relationships. In particular, we have investigated how couples use video to "hang out" together and engage in activities over extended periods of time. Our results show that regardless of the relationship situation, video chat affords a unique opportunity for couples to share presence over distance, which in turn provides intimacy. While beneficial, couples still face challenges in using video chat, including contextual (e.g., location of partners, time zones), technical (e.g., mobility, audio/video quality, networking), and personal (e.g., a lack of physicality needed by most for intimate sexual acts) challenges.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207785">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1145"><a class="title" href="Session123.html#paper1145">How Do Couples Use CheekTouch over Phone Calls?</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Young-Woo_Park">Young-Woo Park</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Korea_Advanced_Institute_of_Science_and_Technology">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Korea, Republic of</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Seok-Hyung_Bae">Seok-Hyung Bae</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Korea_Advanced_Institute_of_Science_and_Technologhy">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technologhy, Korea, Republic of</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tek-Jin_Nam">Tek-Jin Nam</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Korea_Advanced_Institute_of_Science_and_Technology">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Korea, Republic of</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes how romantic couples use a novel audio-tactile communication technique called CheekTouch over phone calls.

Prior work suggests that affordances of social media might highlight and shape these tensions; to explore this, we asked 20 people to reflect daily for two weeks on feelings and decisions around their own and others' Facebook use related to their relationships. Most generally, we find that tensions arise when romantic partners must manage multiple relationships simultaneously because Facebook audiences are so present and so varied. People also engage in subtle negotiation around and appropriation of Facebook's features to accomplish both personal and relational goals. By capturing both why people make these decisions and how Facebook's affordances support them, we expect our findings to generalize to many other social media tools and to inform theorizing about how these tools affect relational development.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207788">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1202"><a class="title" href="Session123.html#paper1202">Lost in Translation: Understanding the Possession of Digital Things in the Cloud</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#William_Odom">William Odom</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Abi_Sellen">Abi Sellen</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research_Cambridge">Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Richard_Harper">Richard Harper</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eno_Thereska">Eno Thereska</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents and interprets field evidence related to people's perceptions of personal digital things kept in Cloud Computing environments.

This paper explores the effects of mental model soundness on such personalization by providing structural knowledge of a music recommender system in an empirical study. Our findings show that participants were able to quickly build sound mental models of the recommender system's reasoning, and that participants who most improved their mental models during the study were significantly more likely to make the recommender operate to their satisfaction. These results suggest that by helping end users understand a system's reasoning, intelligent agents may elicit more and better feedback, thus more closely aligning their output with each user's intentions.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207678">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1174"><a class="title" href="Session139.html#paper1174">Pay Attention!

In this paper, we draw on techniques from brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and knowledge from educational psychology to design adaptive agents that monitor student attention in real time using measurements from electroencephalography (EEG) and recapture diminishing attention levels using verbal and nonverbal cues. An experimental evaluation of our approach showed that an adaptive robotic agent employing behavioral techniques to regain attention during drops in engagement improved student recall abilities 43% over the baseline regardless of student gender and significantly improved female motivation and rapport.

ReGroup then uses its currently learned model to suggest additional members and group characteristics for filtering. Our evaluation shows that ReGroup is effective for helping people create large and varied groups, whereas traditional methods (searching by name or selecting from an alphabetical list) are better suited for small groups whose members can be easily recalled by name. By facilitating on demand group creation, ReGroup can enable in-context sharing and potentially encourage better online privacy practices. In addition, applying interactive machine learning to social network group creation introduces several challenges for designing effective end-user interaction with machine learning.

Concretely, our approach leverages a family of languages closely related to the speaker's native language to construct translations in a coherent mix of these languages. Experimental results indicate that these translations can be easily understood, being also a useful aid for users who are not proficient in foreign languages. Therefore this work significantly contributes to HCI in two ways: it establishes a language that can improve how applications communicate to their users, and it reports insights on the user acceptance towards the method.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207681">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1121"><a class="title" href="Session139.html#paper1121">"Then Click 'OK!'"

The recognizer first extracts phrases matching a list of known components, then employs a classifier to reject coincidental matches. We describe why this seemingly straightforward problem is challenging, then show how informal conventions in documentation writing can be leveraged to perform classification. Using the features identified in this paper, our approach achieves an average F1 score of 0.81, and can correctly distinguish between actual command references and coincidental matches in 93.7% of test cases.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207682">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S1_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Daniela Rosner, UC Berkeley, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="al137"><a class="title" href="Session1.html#al137">UCD: Critique via Parody and a Sequel</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">alt.chi</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Gilbert_Cockton">Gilbert Cockton</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Northumbria_University">Northumbria University, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This alt.chi paper abandons technical writing conventions to parody user-centred design, and having predicted its imminent demise, more seriously derives a position (BIG design) on what could follow.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> User-Centred Design (UCD) can&#8217;t and doesn&#8217;t design on its own. Parasitic on software design, and appropriating participatory design, UCD is legitimated by what other design traditions allegedly do not do, rather than what UCD actually does make happen. Much Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research doesn&#8217;t design, proudly rejecting any need for implications for design. UCD is strong on problems, but weak on solutions. Such weaknesses have become masked by orthodoxy and disciplinary ideology. Direct challenges to UCD are not welcome within HCI research.

However, understanding and validating the output of these models can itself be a challenging analysis task. In this paper, we offer two design considerations--interpretation and trust--for designing visualizations based on data-driven models. Interpretation refers to the facility with which an analyst makes inferences about the data through the lens of a model abstraction. Trust refers to the actual and perceived accuracy of an analyst's inferences. These considerations derive from our experiences developing the Stanford Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9,000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity, and a subsequent review of existing literature. We contribute a novel similarity measure for text collections based on a notion of "word-borrowing" that arose from an iterative design process. Based on our experiences and a literature review, we distill a set of design recommendations and describe how they promote interpretable and trustworthy visual analysis tools.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207738">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1620"><a class="title" href="Session128.html#paper1620">V-Model: A New Innovative Model to Chronologically Visualize Narrative Clinical Texts</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Heekyong_Park">Heekyong Park</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Seoul_National_University">Seoul National University, Korea, Republic of</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jinwook_Choi">Jinwook Choi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Seoul_National_University">Seoul National University, Korea, Republic of</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Proposes and verifies an innovative timeline model for narrative clinical events.

A cadaster is an official register that records land properties (e.g., location, ownership, value and size) for land valuation and taxation. Such mapping of old and new cadasters can help historians understand the social/economic background of changes in land uses or ownership. With JigsawMap, historians can continue mapping older or newer cadasters. In this way, JigsawMap can connect the past land survey results to today and to the future. We conducted usability studies and long term case studies to evaluate JigsawMap, and received positive responses. As well as summarizing the evaluation results, we also present design guidelines for participatory design projects with historians.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207740">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1970"><a class="title" href="Session128.html#paper1970">Semantic Interaction for Visual Text Analytics</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Alex_Endert">Alex Endert</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Virginia_Tech">Virginia Tech, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Patrick_Fiaux">Patrick Fiaux</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Virginia_Tech">Virginia Tech, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chris_North">Chris North</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Virginia_Tech">Virginia Tech, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Description of design space for user interaction for visual analytics called Semantic Interaction, coupling foraging and synthesis stages of sensemaking. The system, ForceSPIRE, supports users throughout sensemaking for text documents.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Visual analytics emphasizes sensemaking of large, complex datasets through interactively exploring visualizations generated by statistical models. For example, dimensionality reduction methods use various similarity metrics to visualize textual document collections in a spatial metaphor, where similarities between documents are approximately represented through their relative spatial distances to each other in a 2D layout. This metaphor is designed to mimic analysts&#65533; mental models of the document collection and support their analytic processes, such as clustering similar documents together. However, in current methods, users must interact with such visualizations using controls external to the visual metaphor, such as sliders, menus, or text fields, to directly control underlying model parameters that they do not understand and that do not relate to their analytic process occurring within the visual metaphor. In this paper, we present the opportunity for a new design space for visual analytic interaction, called semantic interaction, which seeks to enable analysts to spatially interact with such models directly within the visual metaphor using interactions that derive from their analytic process, such as searching, highlighting, annotating, and repositioning documents. Further, we demonstrate how semantic interactions can be implemented using machine learning techniques in a visual analytic tool, called ForceSPIRE, for interactive analysis of textual data within a spatial visualization.  Analysts can express their expert domain knowledge about the documents by simply moving them, which guides the underlying model to improve the overall layout, taking the user&#65533;s feedback into account.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207741">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S2_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Jofish Kaye, Nokia Research Center, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="al116"><a class="title" href="Session2.html#al116">I Just Made Love: The System and the Subject of Experience</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">alt.chi</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Gopinaath_Kannabiran">Gopinaath Kannabiran</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University,_Bloomington">Indiana University, Bloomington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jeffrey_Bardzell">Jeffrey Bardzell</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University">Indiana University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Shaowen_Bardzell">Shaowen Bardzell</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University">Indiana University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>In this work, we propose a new paradigm to understand experience design by focusing on the subject of interaction as opposed to the existing paradigm which is the user.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Experience has become increasingly relevant to the field of HCI in recent decades and a number of approaches have been drawn from multiple disciplines to engage this rich and elusive topic.

We employ an `augmented' storytelling methodology where we manipulate the modality of an `emotive' channel that accompanies the speech, and the contextual expectation of the listener. Comparing a remote upper-arm touch against a similarly timed flashing light, we explore the importance of the touch modality in affect conveyance.  Our second manipulation involves two cover stories where the listener is told that the touch or flashing light is triggered either by the storyteller expressively squeezing a touch input device while speaking, or by measured `high points' in the mental state of the storyteller. Our results show that the story accompanied by communicative touch resulted in a significant increase in the sense of connectedness with the storyteller over the speech-only condition, and a trend toward greater affective conveyance.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207697">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper631"><a class="title" href="Session127.html#paper631">TAP &amp; PLAY:  An End-User Toolkit for Authoring Interactive Pen and Paper Language Activities</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="cci" src="images/cci.png" alt="Community: cci" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Anne_Marie_Piper">Anne Marie Piper</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California,_San_Diego">University of California, San Diego, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nadir_Weibel">Nadir Weibel</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California_San_Diego">University of California San Diego, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#James_D_Hollan">James D Hollan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#UCSD">UCSD, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This paper presents a toolkit for authoring interactive multimodal language activities using a digital pen.

The familiarity of pen and paper makes it a particularly attractive media for many user groups, including young children.

Currently, generating custom interactive paper documents involves some programming, limiting its use by many user groups (e.g., educators and families) who might especially benefit from application of hybrid paper-digital interfaces in their practices. To address this need, we developed an end-user Toolkit for Authoring Pen and Paper Language Activities (TAP &amp; PLAY). This paper describes the iterative development of the toolkit, its accessibility for novice non-technical users, and use in three different contexts for early language learning.

Within information studies, researchers [such as 32, 6] have shown how individual events of selection and description inevitably form judgments about the collected materials. This paper describes a process in which designers purposefully use the elements of selection, description, organization, and arrangement to "write" a resource collection as a form of rhetorical expression. The design process was implemented in two classroom settings. In the more successful second implementation, the role of the audience in structuring a rhetorical interaction was emphasized, and collection design was conceptualized as designing a dialogue between author and audience. The formalized critique of existing collection designs was a key element in enabling this dialogic orientation.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207725">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S129_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Antonello De Angeli, University of Trento, Italy</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="to122"><a class="title" href="Session129.html#to122">The Role of Gender on Effectiveness and Efficiency of User-Robot Communication in Navigation Tasks</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">ToCHI</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Theodora_Koulouri">Theodora Koulouri</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Brunel_University">Brunel University, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Stanislao_Lauria">Stanislao Lauria</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Brunel_University">Brunel University, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Robert_D._Macredie">Robert D.

Presents a novel methodology and design recommendations for dialogue and navigating systems that equally support users of both genders.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Many studies have identified gender differences in communication related to spatial navigation in real and virtual worlds.  Most of this research has focused on single-party communication (monologues), such as the way in which individuals either give or follow route instructions.  However, very little work has been reported on spatial navigation dialogues and whether there are gender differences in the way that they are conducted.  This paper will address the lack of research evidence by exploring the dialogues between partners of the same and of different gender in a simulated Human-Robot Interaction study.  In the experiments discussed in this paper, pairs of participants communicated remotely; in each pair, one participant (the instructor) was under the impression that s/he was giving route instructions to a robot (the follower), avoiding any perception of gendered communication.  To ensure the naturalness of the interaction, the followers were given no guidelines on what to say, however each had to control a robot based on the user&#8217;s instructions.  While many monologue-based studies suggest male superiority in a multitude of spatial activities and domains, this study of dialogues highlights a more complex pattern of results.  As anticipated, gender influences task performance and communication.  However, the findings suggest that it is the interaction &#8211; the combination of gender and role (i.e., instructor or follower) &#8211; that has the most significant impact.  In particular, pairs of female users/instructors and male &#8216;robots&#8217;/followers are associated with the fastest and most accurate completion of the navigation tasks.  Moreover, dialogue-based analysis illustrates how pairs of male users/instructors and female &#8216;robots&#8217;/followers achieved successful communication through &#8216;alignment&#8217; of spatial descriptions.  In particular, males seem to adapt the content of their instructions when interacting with female &#8216;robots&#8217;/followers and employ more landmark references compared to female users/instructors or when addressing males (in male-male pairings).  This study describes the differences in how males and females interact with the system, and proposes that any female &#8216;disadvantage&#8217; in spatial communication can disappear through interactive mechanisms.  Such insights are important for the design of navigation systems that are equally effective for users of either gender.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1916"><a class="title" href="Session129.html#paper1916">Ripple Effects of an Embedded Social Agent: A Field Study of a Social Robot in the Workplace</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Min_Kyung_Lee">Min Kyung Lee</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sara_Kiesler">Sara Kiesler</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jodi_Forlizzi">Jodi Forlizzi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Paul_Rybski">Paul Rybski</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describe a long-term field study of a social delivery robot in a workplace.

Much of this research has been pursued in labs and brief field studies. Comparatively little is known about social agents embedded in the workplace, where employees have repeated interactions with the agent, alone and with others. We designed a social robot snack delivery service for a workplace, and evaluated the service over four months allowing each employee to use it for two months. We report on how employees responded to the robot and the service over repeated encounters. Employees attached different social roles to the robot beyond a delivery person as they incorporated the robot's visit into their workplace routines. Beyond one-on-one interaction, the robot created a ripple effect in the workplace, triggering new behaviors among employees, including politeness, protection of the robot, mimicry, social comparison, and even jealousy. We discuss the implications of these ripple effects for designing services incorporating social agents.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207776">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper672"><a class="title" href="Session129.html#paper672">Designing Effective Gaze Mechanisms for Virtual Agents</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sean_Andrist">Sean Andrist</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Wisconsin--Madison">University of Wisconsin--Madison, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tomislav_Pejsa">Tomislav Pejsa</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Bilge_Mutlu">Bilge Mutlu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michael_Gleicher">Michael Gleicher</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Wisconsin_-_Madison,_Madison">University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>A model for designing effective gaze mechanisms for virtual agents and its evaluation.

Drawing on research in human physiology, we developed a model of gaze behavior to capture these key design variables. In a user study, we investigated how manipulations in these variables might improve affiliation with the agent and learning. The results showed that an agent using affiliative gaze elicited more positive feelings of connection, while an agent using referential gaze improved participants' learning.

The ubiquity of pen-enabled technologies in teaching has made the accurate capture of user ink data possible, alongside technologies to recognize voice data.

The availability of sketch data and voice data can enable researchers to analyze trends followed by teachers in writing and annotating notes.  Using ethnographic methods, we have observed the structure that teachers use while presenting lectures on mathematics. We have observed the practices followed by teachers in writing and speaking the lecture content, and have derived models that would help computer scientists identify the structure of the content. This observational study motivates the idea that we can use speech and color change events to distinguish between strokes meant for drawing versus those meant for attention marks. </span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs171"><a class="title" href="Session204.html#cs171">Employing Virtual Worlds for HCI Education: A Problem-Based Learning Approach</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Panagiotis_Zaharias">Panagiotis Zaharias</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Open_University_of_Cyprus">Open University of Cyprus, Cyprus</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Marios_Belk">Marios Belk</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Cyprus">University of Cyprus, Cyprus</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#George_Samaras">George Samaras</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Cyprus">University of Cyprus, Cyprus</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This case study documents experiences from teaching an HCI course by employing 3D virtual worlds.

In this paper we explore how Ubicomp and HCI studies have approached the notion of privacy, often as a quantifiable concept. Leaning on several theoretical frameworks, but in particular Nissenbaum's notion of contextual integrity, we question the viability of obtaining universal answers in terms of people's "general" privacy practices and apply elements of Nissenbaum's theory to our own data in order to illustrate its relevance. We then suggest restructuring inquiries into information sharing in studies of state-of-the-art technologies and analyze contextually grounded issues using a different, more specific vocabulary. Finally, we provide the first building blocks to such vocabulary.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207727">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1043"><a class="title" href="Session134.html#paper1043">Tag, You Can See It!

Participants fixated twice as long when ads contained their photo.  Participants reported being more likely to notice ads with their photo, holiday destination, and name, but also increasing levels of discomfort with increasing personalization.  We conclude that greater personalization in ad content may achieve higher levels of attention, but that the most personalized ads are also the least acceptable.  The noticeability benefit in using someone's photo to make them look at an ad may be offset by the privacy cost.

Often, users locate the content using a search engine, copy it into their work, cross their fingers, and hope they do not infringe on any copyrights. While the authors have shared hundreds of millions of images with permissive licenses, the license terms are too complicated for other users to follow. In our studies, we found that even the well-intentioned users still fail to respect copyrights in simple image reuse situations.

The results of our multivariate study of over 45,000 players show that the usefulness of tutorials depends greatly on game complexity.

However, the current literature often focuses on best practice design strategies and frameworks. Fine-grained details, contextual descriptions, and organisational factors that are invaluable in helping us to learn from and reflect on project experiences are often overlooked. In this paper, we present five distinct and sometimes competing perspectives that are critical in understanding factors that influence serious game projects: project organisation, technology, domain knowledge, user research, and game design. We explain these perspectives by providing insights from the design and development process of an EU-funded serious game about conflict resolution developed by an interdisciplinary consortium of researchers and industry-based developers. We also point out a set of underlying forces that become evident from viewing the process from different perspectives, to underscore that problems exist in serious game projects and that we should open the conversation about them. </span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207688">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1330"><a class="title" href="Session133.html#paper1330">Not Doing But Thinking: The Role Of Challenge In Immersive Videogames</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Anna_L_Cox">Anna L Cox</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_London">University College London, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Paul_Cairns">Paul Cairns</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_York">University of York, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Pari_Shah">Pari Shah</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_London">University College London, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michael_Carroll">Michael Carroll</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_York">University of York, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Three experiments manipulate challenge of a video game.

However, defining exactly which challenges are important and which aspects of gaming experience are affected is largely under-explored. In this paper, we investigate if altering the level of challenge in a videogame influences people's experience of immersion. Our first study demonstrates that simply increasing the physical demands of the game by requiring gamers to interact more with the game does not result in increased immersion.  In a further two studies, we use time pressure to make games more physically and cognitively challenging. We find that the addition of time pressure increases immersion as predicted.  We argue that the level of challenge experienced is an interaction between the level of expertise of the gamer and the cognitive challenge encompassed within the game.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207689">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper602"><a class="title" href="Session133.html#paper602">Understanding User Experience in Stereoscopic 3D Games</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jonas_Schild">Jonas Schild</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Duisburg-Essen">University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Joseph_LaViola">Joseph LaViola</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Central_Florida">University of Central Florida, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Maic_Masuch">Maic Masuch</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Duisburg-Essen">University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Evaluates the impact of stereoscopic vision on user experience with digital games.

Stereoscopic 3D graphics promise a better gaming experience but this potential has not yet been proven empirically. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study that evaluates player experience of three stereoscopic games in comparison with their monoscopic counterparts. We examined 60 participants, each playing one of the three games, using three self-reporting questionnaires and one psychophysiological instrument. Our main results are (1) stereoscopy in games increased experienced immersion, spatial presence, and simulator sickness; (2) the effects strongly differed across the three games and for both genders, indicating more affect on male users and with games involving depth animations; (3) results related to attention and cognitive involvement indicate more direct and less thoughtful interactions with stereoscopic games, pointing towards a more natural experience through stereoscopy.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207690">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S137_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Vicki Hanson, University of Dundee, UK</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1716"><a class="title" href="Session137.html#paper1716">CrossingGuard: Exploring Information Content in Navigation Aids for the Visually Impaired</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Richard_T_Guy">Richard T Guy</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Khai_N_Truong">Khai N Truong</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>User study to investigate the information needs of visually impaired pedestrians at intersections.

Technological aids such as customized GPS navigation tools offer the chance to augment visually impaired pedestrians&#65533; sensory information with a richer depiction of an environment, but care must be taken to balance the need for more information with other demands on the senses. In this paper, we focus on the information needs of visually impaired pedestrians at intersections, which present a specific cause of stress when navigating in unfamiliar locations. We present a navigation application prototype called CrossingGuard that provides rich information to a user such as details about intersection geometry that are not available to visually impaired pedestrians today. A user study comparing content-rich information to a baseline condition shows that content-rich information raises the level of comfort that visually impaired pedestrians feel at unfamiliar intersections. In addition, we discuss the categories of information that are most useful. Finally, we introduce a micro-task approach to gather intersection data via Street View annotations that achieves 85.5% accuracy over the 9 categories of information used by CrossingGuard.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207733">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper845"><a class="title" href="Session137.html#paper845">SpaceSense: Representing Geographical Information to Visually Impaired People Using Spatial Tactile Feedback</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Koji_Yatani">Koji Yatani</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nikola_Banovic">Nikola Banovic</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Khai_N_Truong">Khai N Truong</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Investigates a mobile interface that helps people with visual impairments learn directions to a location and its spatial relationships with other locations on a map through spatial tactile feedback.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Learning an environment can be challenging for people with visual impairments. Braille maps allow their users to understand the spatial relationship between a set of places. However, physical Braille maps are often costly, may not always cover an area of interest with sufficient detail, and might not present up-to-date information. We built a handheld system for representing geographical information called SpaceSense, which includes custom spatial tactile feedback hardware&#65533;multiple vibration motors attached to different locations on a mobile touch-screen device. It offers high-level information about the distance and direction towards a destination and bookmarked places through vibrotactile feedback to help the user maintain the spatial relationships between these points. SpaceSense also adapts a summarization technique for online user reviews of public and commercial venues. Our user study shows that participants could build and maintain the spatial relationships between places on a map more accurately with SpaceSense compared to a system without spatial tactile feedback. They pointed specifically to having spatial tactile feedback as the contributing factor in successfully building and maintaining their mental map.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207734">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper174"><a class="title" href="Session137.html#paper174">The User as a Sensor: Navigating Users with Visual Impairments in Indoor Spaces using Tactile Landmarks</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Navid_Fallah">Navid Fallah</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nevada,_Reno">University of Nevada, Reno, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ilias_Apostolopoulos">Ilias Apostolopoulos</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nevada,_Reno">University of Nevada, Reno, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Kostas_Bekris">Kostas Bekris</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nevada,_Reno">University of Nevada, Reno, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eelke_Folmer">Eelke Folmer</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nevada,_Reno">University of Nevada, Reno, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes an indoor navigation system that appropriates the user to be a sensor.

Task-based user evaluations were undertaken on 16 websites, yielding 1383 instances of user problems.  The results showed that only 50.4% of the problems encountered by users were covered by Success Criteria in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0).   For user problems that were covered by WCAG 2.0, 16.7% of websites implemented techniques recommended in WCAG 2.0 but the techniques did not solve the problems.  These results show that few developers are implementing the current version of WCAG, and even when the guidelines are implemented on websites there is little indication that people with disabilities will encounter fewer problems.  The paper closes by discussing the implications of this study for future research and practice. In particular, it discusses the need to move away from a problem-based approach towards a design principle approach for web accessibility.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207736">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S135_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Michael Rohs, University of Munich, Germany</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper981"><a class="title" href="Session135.html#paper981">TeleAdvisor: A Versatile Augmented Reality Tool for Remote Assistance</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/best.png" class="best" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Pavel_Gurevich">Pavel Gurevich</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#IBM_Research,_Haifa">IBM Research, Haifa, Israel</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Joel_Lanir">Joel Lanir</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Haifa">University of Haifa, Israel</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Benjamin_Cohen">Benjamin Cohen</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#IBM_Research">IBM Research, Israel</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ran_Stone">Ran Stone</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#IBM_Research_-_Haifa">IBM Research - Haifa, Israel</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a hands-free transportable augmented reality system, consisting of a camera and a pico projector mounted on a tele-operated robotic arm.

Existing DMVN systems deal with these cases by either disabling navigation on the paused object or by allowing jumps in the timeline. Both of these workarounds are undesirable as they introduce inconsistency or provoke loss of context. We analyze current practices regarding temporal ambiguities and introduce two new methods to visualize and navigate object pauses. User tests show that the new approaches are better suited for navigation in scenes containing temporal ambiguities and are rated higher in terms of user satisfaction.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207764">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper499"><a class="title" href="Session135.html#paper499">CamBlend: An Object Focused Collaboration Tool</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#James_Norris">James Norris</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Mixed_Reality_Lab,_University_of_Nottingham">Mixed Reality Lab, University of Nottingham, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Holger_Schn&#228;delbach">Holger Schn&#228;delbach</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Mixed_Reality_Lab,_Computer_Science,_University_of_Nottingham">Mixed Reality Lab, Computer Science, University of Nottingham, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Guoping_Qiu">Guoping Qiu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nottingham">University of Nottingham, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>New panoramic focus+context video collaboration system designed to facilitate the interaction with and around objects.

In contrast, public health research argues for an activist approach focused on how certain groups disproportionately experience disease and eliminating these disparities. Taking this activist stance, we examine how technology can reduce health inequalities by disrupting power relationships and helping communities pursue social change. We discuss our tool, Community Mosaic (CM), which allows individuals to share their healthy eating ideas with one another as a means of advocating behavior change. Our results characterize how CM helped facilitate activism (i.e., collective efforts to counter local challenges to healthy living) and shift users&#65533; attitudes regarding their role as advocates for health. We contribute to the field of HCI by using our findings to present a set of recommendations for future research focused on designing and evaluating health promotion tools using an activist lens.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207692">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1182"><a class="title" href="Session136.html#paper1182">Augmented Perception of Satiety: Controlling Food Consumption by Changing Apparent Size of Food with Augmented Reality</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Takuji_Narumi">Takuji Narumi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#the_Univ._of_Tokyo">the Univ. of Tokyo, Japan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Yuki_Ban">Yuki Ban</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#the_Univ._of_Tokyo">the Univ. of Tokyo, Japan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Takashi_Kajinami">Takashi Kajinami</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#the_Univ._of_Tokyo">the Univ. of Tokyo, Japan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tomohiro_Tanikawa">Tomohiro Tanikawa</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#The_University_of_Tokyo">The University of Tokyo, Japan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michitaka_Hirose">Michitaka Hirose</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#the_Univ._of_Tokyo">the Univ. of Tokyo, Japan</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>The main contribution of this paper is to realize a method for modifying perception of satiety and controlling nutritional intake by changing the apparent size of food with augmented reality.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> The main contribution of this paper is to realize a method for modifying perception of satiety and controlling nutritional intake by changing the apparent size of food with augmented reality. As a possible method for decreasing rates of obesity, we focused on controlling food intake implicitly without any effort. <br />We hypothesized that ambiguous perception of satiety can be applied to control our food intake. Recent psychological studies have revealed that the amount of food consumed is influenced by both its actual volume and external factors during eating. Based on this knowledge, we sought to control perception of satiety gained from the same amount of food by changing its apparent size. We also proposed a method for food-volume augmentation using real-time shape deformation. Our results suggest that this augmentation can control the perception of satiety and food intake.   </span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207693">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1539"><a class="title" href="Session136.html#paper1539">Laying the Table for HCI: Uncovering Ecologies of Domestic Food Consumption</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Annika_Hupfeld">Annika Hupfeld</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nottingham">University of Nottingham, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tom_Rodden">Tom Rodden</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nottingham">University of Nottingham, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Study of family eating practices in the home and the artefacts and spaces involved.

We report on the results of two user studies. The first one compares the quality of the set of thumbnails selected by the technology to sets selected by 31 humans.   The second study examines the clickthrough rates for both email formats (with and without hyperlinked thumbnails) as well as gathering subjective feedback via survey. Results indicate that the email messages with the thumbnails drove significantly higher clickthrough rates than the messages without, even though people clicked on the main video link more frequently than the thumbnails.

Arguments in environmental studies, anthropology, and other fields indicate that this transformation could begin within the next half-century. While imminent collapse is far from certain, it is prudent to consider now how to develop sociotechnical systems for use in these scenarios. We introduce the notion of collapse informatics - the study, design, and development of sociotechnical systems in the abundant present for use in a future of scarcity - as a complement to ICT4D and mitigation-oriented sustainable HCI. We draw on a variety of literatures to offer a set of relevant concepts and articulate the relationships among them to orient and evaluate collapse informatics work. Observing that collapse informatics poses a unique class of cross-cultural design problems, we sketch the design space of collapse informatics and provide a variety of example projects. We explore points of connection and distinction between collapse informatics and sustainable HCI, ICT4D, and crisis informatics. Finally, we discuss next steps and comment on the potential value of collapse informatics work even in the event that collapse never occurs.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207770">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1023"><a class="title" href="Session130.html#paper1023">Beyond Energy Monitors: Interaction, Energy, and Emerging Energy Systems</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="sustainability" src="images/sustainability.png" alt="Community: sustainability" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#James_Pierce">James Pierce</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eric_Paulos">Eric Paulos</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Reviews energy-related literature from within and outside of HCI.

It provides each household with fine-grained, near real time feedback on their water consumption, as well as using techniques like social comparison, weekly games, and news and chat to encourage water conservation. This study used logs, a survey and interviews to evaluate a 15-week pilot with 303 households. It describes the Portal's design, and discusses its adoption, use and impacts. The system resulted in a 6.6% decrease in water consumption, and the paper employs qualitative methods to look at the ways in which the Portal was (or wasn't) effective in supporting its users and enabling them to reduce their consumption. The paper concludes with a discussion of design implications for residential feedback systems, and possible engagement models.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207772">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper726"><a class="title" href="Session130.html#paper726">Embedded interaction in a Water Fountain for Motivating Behavior Change in Public Space</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ernesto_Arroyo">Ernesto Arroyo</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Universitat_Pompeu_Fabra">Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Leonardo_Bonanni">Leonardo Bonanni</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#MIT_Media_Laboratory">MIT Media Laboratory, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nina_Valkanova">Nina Valkanova</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Universitat_Pompeu_Fabra">Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents an augmented water fountain with audiovisual feedback aimed at improving and motivating the water-drinking experience.

We designed an interactive installation that uses visual feedback to the incidental movements of passers-by to communicate its interactivity. The lab study reveals: (1) Mirrored user silhouettes and images are more effective than avatar-like representations. (2) It takes time to notice the interactivity (approx. 1.2s). In the field study, three displays were installed during three weeks in shop windows, and data about 502 interaction sessions were collected. Our observations show: (1) Significantly more passers-by interact when immediately showing the mirrored user image (+90%) or silhouette (+47%) compared to a traditional attract sequence with call-to-action. (2) Passers-by often notice interactivity late and have to walk back to interact (the landing effect). (3) If somebody is already interacting, others begin interaction behind the ones already interacting, forming multiple rows. Our findings can be used to design public display applications and shop windows that more effectively communicate interactivity to passers-by.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2207718">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper340"><a class="title" href="Session124.html#paper340">Urban HCI: Spatial Aspects in the Design of Shared Encounters for Media Facades</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="arts" src="images/arts.png" alt="Community: arts" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Patrick_Tobias_Fischer">Patrick Tobias Fischer</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Strathclyde_University">Strathclyde University, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eva_Hornecker">Eva Hornecker</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Strathclyde">University of Strathclyde, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We propose a terminology and a model for large-scale screens in urban environments.

The study was inspired by the phenomenal uptake of Internet use in the country coupled with a need to explore how micro-entrepreneurs are faring in this space, what potential exists, and how it could be realized. The findings of the study show that the Internet can be the new frontier for many micro-entrepreneurs who want to take their businesses to the next level. The study also provides critical insights into the realities of micro-enterprise, and hence relevant issues to take into consideration in seeking to take micro-enterprise online.  The insights therein cover such issues as affordability of solutions, quick return on investment, convergence of current business methods and practices with those presented by an online environment for greater impact, and need for very simple, intuitive web design tools and platforms. Innovation may be required so as to come up with more website options that are better suited to the needs of micro-entrepreneurs and that are cost-effective.

We developed TimeBlocks, a novel tangible, playful object to facilitate communication about concepts of time with young children. TimeBlocks consists of a set of cubic blocks that function as a physical progress bar. Parents and children can physically manipulate the blocks to represent the concept of time. We evaluated TimeBlocks through a field study in which six families tried TimeBlocks for four days at their homes.  The results indicate that TimeBlocks played a useful role in facilitating the often challenging task of time-related communication between parents and children. We also report on a range of observed insightful novel uses of TimeBlocks in our study.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208299">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="vi145"><a class="title" href="Session39.html#vi145">An Augmented Multi-touch System Using Hand and Finger Identification</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Videos</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Peter_Kung">Peter Kung</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Cornell_University">Cornell University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Dominik_Kaeser">Dominik Kaeser</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Pixar_Animation_Studios">Pixar Animation Studios, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Craig_Schroeder">Craig Schroeder</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California,_Los_Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tony_DeRose">Tony DeRose</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Pixar_Animation_Studios">Pixar Animation Studios, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Donald_Greenberg">Donald Greenberg</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Cornell_University">Cornell University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Kenrick_Kin">Kenrick Kin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Pixar_Animation_Studios">Pixar Animation Studios, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We introduce a multitouch system capable of identifying the finger and hand corresponding to each touch, and show how we use it in a multitouch 3D authoring tool.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> With the advent of devices such as smart phones and tablet computers, multi-touch applications are rapidly becoming commonplace.

To overcome this deficiency we introduce a multi-touch system that is capable of identifying the finger and hand corresponding to each touch. The system consists of a commercially available capacitive multi-touch display augmented with an infrared depth camera mounted above the surface of the display. We performed a user study to measure the accuracy of the system and found that our algorithm was correct on 92.7% of the trials.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="vi135"><a class="title" href="Session39.html#vi135">TEROOS: A Wearable Avatar to Enhance Joint Activities (Video Preview)</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Videos</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tadakazu_Kashiwabara">Tadakazu Kashiwabara</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Keio_University">Keio University, Japan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Hirotaka_Osawa">Hirotaka Osawa</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Keio_University">Keio University, Japan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Kazuhiko_Shinozawa">Kazuhiko Shinozawa</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#ATR_Intelligent_Robotics_and_Communication_Laboratories">ATR Intelligent Robotics and Communication Laboratories, Japan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michita_Imai">Michita Imai</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Keio_University">Keio University, Japan</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>The video shows what communication style a wearable robot avatar offers to daily life situations.

Research has shown that electro-tactile tongue displays paired with cameras can be used as vision prosthetics for the blind or visually impaired; users quickly learn to read and navigate through natural environments, and many describe the signals as an innate sense. However, existing displays are expensive and difficult to adapt. Tongueduino is an inexpensive, vinyl-cut tongue display designed to interface with many types of sensors besides cameras. Connected to a magnetometer, for example, the system provides a user with an internal sense of direction, like a migratory bird. Piezo whiskers allow a user to sense orientation, wind, and the lightest touch.  Through tongueduino, we hope to bring electro-tactile sensory substitution beyond the discourse of vision replacement, towards open-ended sensory augmentation that anyone can access.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="vi147"><a class="title" href="Session39.html#vi147">Pen-in-Hand Command: NUI for Real-Time Strategy eSports</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Videos</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#William_Hamilton">William Hamilton</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Interface_Ecology_Lab,_Texas_A&amp;M_University">Interface Ecology Lab, Texas A&amp;M University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Andruid_Kerne">Andruid Kerne</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Interface_Ecology_Lab,_Texas_A&amp;M_University">Interface Ecology Lab, Texas A&amp;M University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jonathan_Moeller">Jonathan Moeller</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Interface_Ecology_Lab">Interface Ecology Lab, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We investigate the design of embodied interaction in the context of real-time strategy eSports.

Interactions are logged over time for analysis. The bag was devised as a means of investigating how to design interactions in the context of a fun, physical, familiar object. Preliminary studies suggest that users are surprised and engaged, and that first-time users spend more time in their first encounter if the bag is running an &#8216;unexpected&#8217; program (e.g., giggling on impact rather than grunting). However, some users are sensitive about the nature of images and sounds associated with the bag, particularly where there is a conflict with social expectations or values. So far, the interactions that hold users&#8217; attention are those, like the musical &#8216;punching bag keyboard&#8217;, that combine moderate physical activity with a creative element or an intellectual challenge.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="vi108"><a class="title" href="Session39.html#vi108">Haptic Lotus - A Theatre Experience for Blind and Sighted Audiences</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Videos</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="arts" src="images/arts.png" alt="Community: arts" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Janet_van_der_Linden">Janet van der Linden</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#The_Open_University">The Open University, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Terry_Braun">Terry Braun</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Braunarts">Braunarts, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Yvonne_Rogers">Yvonne Rogers</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_London">University College London, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Maria_Oshodi">Maria Oshodi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Extant,_London,_UK">Extant, London, UK, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Adam_Spiers">Adam Spiers</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Bristol_Robotics_Laboratory_(BRL)">Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL), UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#David_McGoran">David McGoran</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_the_West_of_England">University of the West of England, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Rafael_Cronin">Rafael Cronin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University">Indiana University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Paul_O'Dowd">Paul O'Dowd</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Bristol_Robotics_Laboratory">Bristol Robotics Laboratory, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Can technologies facilitate comparable cultural experiences for both blind and sighted audiences?

Using pattern recognition techniques, we built a classifier to recognize unique biometric gesture characteristics of an individual. We achieved a 90% accuracy rate with single gestures, and saw significant improvement when multiple gestures were performed in sequence. We found user ratings of a gestures desirable characteristics (ease, pleasure, excitement) correlated with a gestures actual biometric recognition ratethat is to say, user ratings aligned well with gestural security, in contrast to typical text-based passwords.

Extent refers to the size of an environment, whereas scale refers to whether people have to travel through an environment to see the detail necessary for navigation. Each participant was provided with full body-based information (walking through the virtual marketplaces in a large tracking hall or on an omni-directional treadmill), just the translational component of body-based information (walking on a linear treadmill, but turning with a joystick), just the rotational component (physically turning but using a joystick to translate) or no body-based information (joysticks to translate and rotate). In large and small environments translational body-based information significantly improved the accuracy of participants&#8217; cognitive maps, measured using estimates of direction and relative straight line distance but, on its own, rotational body-based information had no effect. In environments of small extent, full body-based information also improved participants&#8217; navigational performance. The experiments show that locomotion devices such as linear treadmills would bring substantial benefits to virtual environment applications where large spaces are navigated, and theories of human navigation need to reconsider the contribution made by body-based information, and distinguish between environmental scale and extent.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1055"><a class="title" href="Session141.html#paper1055">Putting Your Best Foot Forward: Investigating Real-World Mappings for Foot-based Gestures</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jason_Alexander">Jason Alexander</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Lancaster_University">Lancaster University, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Teng_Han">Teng Han</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#William_Judd">William Judd</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Pourang_Irani">Pourang Irani</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Manitoba">University of Manitoba, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sriram_Subramanian">Sriram Subramanian</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This paper investigates real-world mappings of foot-based gestures to virtual workspaces.

This paper investigates suitable real-world mappings of foot gestures to invoke commands and interact with virtual workspaces. Our first study identified user preferences for mapping common mobile-device commands to gestures. We distinguish these gestures in terms of discrete and continuous command input. While discrete foot-based input has relatively few parameters to control, continuous input requires careful design considerations on how the user's input can be mapped to a control parameter (e.g. the volume knob of the media player). We investigate this issue further through three user-studies. Our results show that rate-based techniques are significantly faster, more accurate and result if far fewer target crossings compared to displacement-based interaction. We discuss these findings and identify design recommendations.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208575">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper463"><a class="title" href="Session141.html#paper463">ShoeSense: A New Perspective on Gestural Interaction and Wearable Applications</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Gilles_Bailly">Gilles Bailly</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Quality_and_Usability_Lab,_Telekom_Innovation_Laboratories,_TU_Berlin">Quality and Usability Lab, Telekom Innovation Laboratories, TU Berlin, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#J&#246;rg_M&#252;ller">J&#246;rg M&#252;ller</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Quality_and_Usability_Lab,_Telekom_Innovation_Laboratories,_TU_Berlin">Quality and Usability Lab, Telekom Innovation Laboratories, TU Berlin, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michael_Rohs">Michael Rohs</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Munich">University of Munich, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Daniel_Wigdor">Daniel Wigdor</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sven_Kratz">Sven Kratz</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Munich">University of Munich, Germany</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a novel wearable device consisting of a shoe-mounted sensor and offering a novel and unique perspective for eyes-free gestural interaction.

To address this concern, we developed ShoeSense, a wearable system consisting in part of a shoe-mounted depth sensor pointing upward at the wearer. ShoeSense recognizes relaxed and discreet as well as large and demonstrative hand gestures. In particular, we designed three gesture sets (Triangle, Radial, and Finger-Count) for this setup, which can be performed without visual attention. The advantages of ShoeSense are illustrated in five scenarios: (1) quickly performing frequent operations without reaching for the phone, (2) discreetly performing operations without disturbing others, (3) enhancing operations on mobile devices, (4) supporting accessibility, and (5) artistic performances. We present a proof-of-concept, wearable implementation based on a depth camera and report on a lab study comparing social acceptability, physical and mental demand, and user preference. A second study demonstrates a 94-99% recognition rate of our recognizers.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208576">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1064"><a class="title" href="Session141.html#paper1064">Bootstrapper: Recognizing Tabletop Users by their Shoes</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Stephan_Richter">Stephan Richter</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Hasso_Plattner_Institute">Hasso Plattner Institute, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Christian_Holz">Christian Holz</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Hasso_Plattner_Institute">Hasso Plattner Institute, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Patrick_Baudisch">Patrick Baudisch</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Hasso_Plattner_Institute">Hasso Plattner Institute, Germany</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Reformulating the user recognition problem as a shoe recognition problem and present a prototype that recognizes tabletop users.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> In order to enable personalized functionality, such as to log tabletop activity by user, tabletop systems need to recognize users. DiamondTouch does so reliably, but requires users to stay in assigned seats and cannot recognize users across sessions. We propose a different approach based on distinguishing users&#65533; shoes. While users are interacting with the table, our system Bootstrapper observes their shoes using one or more depth cameras mounted to the edge of the table. It then identifies users by matching camera images with a database of known shoe images. When multiple users interact, Bootstrapper associates touches with shoes based on hand orientation. The approach can be implemented using consumer depth cameras because (1) shoes offer large distinct features such as color, (2) shoes naturally align themselves with the ground, giving the system a well-defined perspective and thus reduced ambiguity. We report two simple studies in which Bootstrapper recognized participants from a database of 18 users with 95.8% accuracy.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208577">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S146_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>David Ayman Shamma, Yahoo!

Analysis of community differences regarding creation/tolerance of profanity on social news site suggests new approach.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> As user-generated Web content increases, the amount of inappropriate and/or objectionable content also grows. Several scholarly communities are addressing how to detect and manage such content: research in computer vision focuses on detection of inappropriate images, natural language processing technology has advanced to recognize insults. However, profanity detection systems remain flawed. Current list-based profanity detection systems have two limitations. First, they are easy to circumvent and easily become stale&#8211;that is, they cannot adapt to misspellings, abbreviations, and the fast pace of profane slang evolution. Secondly, they offer a one-size fits all solution; they typically do not accommodate domain, community and context specific needs. However, social settings have their own normative behaviors&#8211;what is deemed acceptable in one community may not be in another. In this paper, through analysis of comments from a social news site, we provide evidence that current systems are performing poorly and evaluate the cases on which they fail. We then address community differences regarding creation/tolerance of profanity and suggest a shift to more contextually nuanced profanity detection systems.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208610">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1924"><a class="title" href="Session146.html#paper1924">Consensus Building in Open Source User Interface Design Discussions</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Roshanak_Zilouchian_Moghaddam">Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Brian_Bailey">Brian Bailey</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Illinois-Urbana">University of Illinois-Urbana, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wai-Tat_Fu">Wai-Tat Fu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Reports on a study of consensus building in user interface design discussions in open source software.

Topically narrow communities will probably attract a homogeneous group of interested in its content and compatible with each other. However, they are likely to attract fewer members than a diverse one because they offer only a subset of the topics. This paper reports an empirical analysis of longitudinal data collected from Twitter, where each new Twitter poster is considered the seed of a potential social collection.

In this paper, we investigate how a statistical model of color naming can enable user interfaces to meaningfully mimic this link and support novel interactions. We present a method for constructing a probabilistic model of color naming from a large, unconstrained set of human color name judgments. We describe how the model can be used to map between colors and names and define metrics for color saliency (how reliably a color is named) and color name distance (the similarity between colors based on naming patterns). We then present a series of applications that demonstrate how color naming models can enhance graphical interfaces: a color dictionary &amp; thesaurus, name-based pixel selection methods for image editing, and evaluation aids for color palette design.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208547">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper2023"><a class="title" href="Session186.html#paper2023">The Untapped Promise of Digital Mind Maps</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Haakon_Faste">Haakon Faste</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Honray_Lin">Honray Lin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Existing mind mapping software applications have been evaluated, ethnographic research performed, and a framework of principles has been developed to inform the design of future tools for collaborative knowledge management.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Digital mind mapping tools present a fertile area for research on human-computer interaction.

We conducted an initial study to identify the set of attributes users attend to when comparing workflows, finding that they consider result quality, their knowledge of commands, and the efficiency of the workflow. We then designed Delta to surface these attributes at three granularities: a high-level, clustered view; an intermediate-level list view that contains workflow summaries; and a low-level detail view that allows users to compare two individual workflows. Finally, we conducted an evaluation of Delta on a small corpus of 30 workflows and found that the intermediate list view provided the best information density. We conclude with thoughts on how such a workflow comparison system could be scaled up to larger corpora in the future.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208549">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1909"><a class="title" href="Session186.html#paper1909">QuickDraw : Improving Drawing Experience for Geometric Diagrams</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Salman_Cheema">Salman Cheema</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Central_Florida">University of Central Florida, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sumit_Gulwani">Sumit Gulwani</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Joseph_LaViola">Joseph LaViola</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Central_Florida">University of Central Florida, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>QuickDraw is a pen-based prototype diagramming that uses constraint inference and a novel beautification algorithm to enable the drawing of precise geometric diagrams</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> We present QuickDraw, a prototype sketch-based drawing <br />tool, that facilitates drawing of precise geometry diagrams <br />that are often drawn by students and academics in several <br />scientific disciplines.

In this paper we introduce Rhythmic Interaction as the use of rhythms for input. We report the results of two experiments that show that (i) rhythmic patterns can be efficiently reproduced by novice users and recognized by computer algorithms, and (ii) rhythmic patterns can be memorized as efficiently as traditional shortcuts when associating them with visual commands. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of Rhythmic Interaction and open the way to a richer repertoire of interaction techniques.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208579">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper531"><a class="title" href="Session179.html#paper531">PULSE: The Design and Evaluation of an Auditory Display to Provide a Social Vibe</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#David_McGookin">David McGookin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Glasgow">University of Glasgow, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Stephen_Brewster">Stephen Brewster</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Glasgow">University of Glasgow, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Investigates the use of ambient audio to present  collocated geo-social media as a user moves through the environment.

The musical tunes can be modulated by our numerical acoustic simulator to create believable acoustic effects generated due to cavity in instruments such as drums. It further allows the users to change the materials, shapes, and sizes of the instruments, thereby offering the capability for both rapid prototyping and active exploration of sound effects by altering various physical parameters.

Our sample contains 310 histories with up to six years duration and 48 associated variables describing various user and music characteristics. Using a principal components analysis, we aggregated these variables into 13 components and found several correlations between them. The analysis especially showed the impact of seasons and a listener's interest in novelty on music choice. Using this information, a sample of a user's listening history or even just demographical data could be used to create personalized interfaces and novel recommendation strategies.

Low-fidelity approaches are ineffective because they are not stressful. <br /> <br />Zero-fidelity simulation develops and invokes the principle of abstraction, focusing on human-information and human-human transfers of meaning, to derive design from work practice.

Our focus is on inter-organizational <br />cooperation practices, thus we examined the cooperation of <br />fire departments, police, public administration, electricity <br />infrastructure operators and citizens. Our empirical material <br />allows to describe reasons and conditions for improvisation. <br />Our resulting recommendations address the support of <br />aggregation and visualization of information, a necessary <br />individualization of information compositions, options for <br />collaborative situation assessment, requirements for <br />informal and formal communication, and accessibility of <br />information resources.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208617">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="to123"><a class="title" href="Session132.html#to123">Supporting Knowledge Sharing and Activity Awareness in Distributed Emergency Management Planning: A Design Research Project</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">ToCHI</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Gregorio_Convertino">Gregorio Convertino</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Xerox_Research_Center_Europe,_Grenoble,_France">Xerox Research Center Europe, Grenoble, France, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Helena_M._Mentis">Helena M.

In three experiments we studied groups using three different prototypes, respectively: a paper-prototype in a collocated work setting, a first software prototype in a distributed setting, and a second, enhanced software prototype in a distributed setting. In this series of studies we tried to better understand the processes of knowledge sharing and activity awareness in complex cooperative work by developing and investigating new tools that can support these processes. We explicate the design rationale behind each prototype and report the results of each experiment investigating it. We discuss how the results from each prototyping phase brought us closer to defining properties of a system that facilitate the sharing and awareness of both content and process knowledge. Our designs enhanced aspects of distributed group performance, in some respects beyond that of comparable face-to-face groups.</span></div></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="noop"></td><td class="session" id="S183"><span class="type">Paper &amp; ToCHI</span><a class="title" href="Session183.html">Pen + Touch</a><span class="room">Room: 12AB</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div></td>

First, the study reveals the ranges of PTA in normal pen use, which can distinguish pen events accidently occurring in normal drawing and writing from those used for mode switch. The natural use profiles also show that azimuth is least likely to cause false pen mode switching while tip pressure is most likely to cause false pen mode switching.

Yet, it remains unclear to what degree these systems bridge the inherent gap between paper and computers when compared to existing paper-only and computer-only interfaces. In particular, given the special properties of paper, such as limited dynamic feedback, how well does an average novice user learn to master an interactive paper system? What factors affect the user performance? And how does the paper interface work in a typical use scenario? <br /> <br />To answer these questions, we conducted two empirical experiments on a generic pen-gesture-based command system, called PapierCraft [Liao, et al., 2008], for paper-based interfaces. With PapierCraft, people can select sections of printed documents and issue commands such as copy and paste, linking and in-text search. The first experiment focused on the user performance of drawing pen gestures on paper. It proves that users can learn the command system in about 30 minutes and achieve a performance comparable to a Table PC-based interface <br />supporting the same gestures. The second experiment examined the application of the command system in active reading tasks. The results show promise for seamless integration of paper and computers in active reading for their combined affordance. In addition, our study reveals some key design issues, such as the pen form factor and feedback of gestures. This paper contributes to better understanding on pros and cons of paper and computers, and sheds light on the design of future interfaces for document interaction.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1485"><a class="title" href="Session183.html#paper1485">A-Coord Input: Coordinating Auxiliary Input Streams for Augmenting Contextual Pen-Based Interactions</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Khalad_Hasan">Khalad Hasan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Manitoba">University of Manitoba, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Xing-Dong_Yang">Xing-Dong Yang</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Alberta">University of Alberta, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Andrea_Bunt">Andrea Bunt</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Manitoba">University of Manitoba, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Pourang_Irani">Pourang Irani</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Manitoba">University of Manitoba, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We explore a-coord input, a technique that involves coordinating two auxiliary pen channels in conjunction.

In this work, we explore the coordinated use of two auxiliary channels, a class of interaction techniques we refer to as a-coord input. Through two separate experiments, we explore the design space of a-coord input. In the first study we identify if users can successfully coordinate two auxiliary channels. We found a strong degree of coordination between channels. In a second experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of a-coord input in a task with multiple steps, such as multi-parameter selection and manipulation. We find that a-coord input facilitates coordination even with a complex, aforethought sequential task. Overall our results indicate that users can control at least two auxiliary input channels in conjunction which can facilitate a number of common tasks can on the pen.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208519">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1065"><a class="title" href="Session183.html#paper1065">Personalized Input: Improving Ten-Finger Touchscreen Typing through Automatic Adaptation</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Leah_Findlater">Leah Findlater</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jacob_O_Wobbrock">Jacob O Wobbrock</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We introduce and evaluate two novel personalized keyboard interfaces.

To explore this potential, we introduce and evaluate two novel personalized keyboard interfaces, both of which adapt their underlying key-press classification models. The first keyboard also visually adapts the location of keys while the second one always maintains a visually stable rectangular layout. A three-session user evaluation showed that the keyboard with the stable rectangular layout significantly improved typing speed compared to a control condition with no personalization. Although no similar benefit was found for the keyboard that also offered visual adaptation, overall subjective response to both new touchscreen keyboards was positive. As personalized keyboards are still an emerging area of research, we also outline a design space that includes dimensions of adaptation and key-press classification features.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208520">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper986"><a class="title" href="Session183.html#paper986">Bimanual Marking Menu for Near Surface Interactions</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Fran&#231;ois_Guimbreti&#232;re">Fran&#231;ois Guimbreti&#232;re</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Cornell_University">Cornell University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chau_Nguyen">Chau Nguyen</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Cornell_University">Cornell University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We describe a mouseless, near-surface version of the Bimanual Marking Menu system.

The essay has three parts. In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208538">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1125"><a class="title" href="Session149.html#paper1125">Sustainably Unpersuaded:  How Persuasion Narrows our Vision of Sustainability</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="sustainability" src="images/sustainability.png" alt="Community: sustainability" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Hronn_Brynjarsdottir">Hronn Brynjarsdottir</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Cornell_University">Cornell University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Maria_H&#229;kansson">Maria H&#229;kansson</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Cornell_University">Cornell University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#James_Pierce">James Pierce</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eric_P.S._Baumer">Eric P.S.

Building on theory from areas including philosophy and design theory, this paper articulates a theoretical framework for conceptualizing the intentional negation of technology (i.e., the undesign of technology), ranging from the inhibition of particular uses of technology to the total erasure or foreclosure of technology. The framework is then expanded upon to articulate additional areas of undesigning, including self-inhibition, exclusion, removal, replacement, restoration, and safeguarding. In conclusion a scheme is offered for addressing questions concerning the disciplinary scope of undesign in the context of HCI, along with suggestions for ways that undesigning may be more strongly incorporated within HCI research.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208540">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper774"><a class="title" href="Session149.html#paper774">Affordances in HCI: Toward a Mediated Action Perspective</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/best.png" class="best" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Victor_Kaptelinin">Victor Kaptelinin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bergen">University of Bergen, Norway</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Bonnie_Nardi">Bonnie Nardi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California,_Irvine">University of California, Irvine, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Discusses analyses of affordances in HCI research and outlines a mediated action perspective on affordances as a relational property of  a three-way interaction between the person, mediational means, and  environment.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Interpretations of the concept of "affordances" in HCI are becoming increasingly diverse, extending well beyond the original Gibsonian meaning. We discuss some of the key analyses of affordances in HCI research and make three related claims. First, we argue that many current interpretations of the concept are essentially incompatible with Gibson. Second, we hold that the Gibsonian concept of affordances, conceptualized as interaction between animals and their environments, provides some important insights, but is, in the end, of limited relevance to HCI research. Third, we call for adopting a mediated action perspective on affordances as an alternative to Gibson's ecological psychology. We outline a view of technology affordances as possibilities for human action mediated by cultural means conceived as a relational property of a three-way interaction between the person, mediational means, and environment. We conclude with a discussion of prospects for future conceptual and empirical explorations of the meditational perspective in HCI research.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208541">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S162_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Jeff Heer, Stanford University, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs119"><a class="title" href="Session162.html#cs119">Experiences with Collaborative, Distributed Predictive Human Performance Modeling</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Bonnie_E._John">Bonnie E.

In contrast, we used predictive human performance modeling in a collaborative, distributed mode and reflect on that experience. We discovered that our tool for modeling, CogTool, while sufficiently functional and expressive to perform the modeling task, did not support collaborative, distributed modeling as well as we would like.  We suggest process improvements in model construction, the management of assumptions, consistency, and communication, and suggest design solutions for the future of CogTool or other modeling tools. We further speculate on the generalization of our experiences to other types of usability evaluation when conducted in a distributed, collaborative environment.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1877"><a class="title" href="Session162.html#paper1877">Comparing Averages in Time Series Data</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michael_Correll">Michael Correll</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Danielle_Albers">Danielle Albers</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Wisconsin_-_Madison">University of Wisconsin - Madison, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Steven_Franconeri">Steven Franconeri</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Northwestern_University">Northwestern University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michael_Gleicher">Michael Gleicher</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Wisconsin_-_Madison,_Madison">University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This paper explores visualizations for efficient summarization through perceptually-motivated design and empirical assessment.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> ABSTRACT <br />Visualizations often seek to aid viewers in assessing the big <br />picture in the data, that is, to make judgments about aggregate <br />properties of the data.

However, the appropriateness of this approach is under increasing criticism, with statisticians, economists, and psychologists arguing against the use of routine interpretation of results using "canned" p values. Three problems with current practice - the fallacy of the transposed conditional, a neglect of power, and the reluctance to interpret the size of effects - can lead us to build weak theories based on vaguely specified hypothesis, resulting in empirical studies which produce results that are of limited practical or scientific use. Using publicly available data presented at CHI 2010 [19] as an example we address each of the three concerns and promote consideration of the magnitude and actual importance of effects, as opposed to statistical significance, as the new criteria for evaluating CHI research.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208557">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1044"><a class="title" href="Session162.html#paper1044">A Spatiotemporal Visualization Approach for the Analysis of Gameplay Data</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Guenter_Wallner">Guenter Wallner</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Applied_Arts_Vienna">University of Applied Arts Vienna, Austria</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Simone_Kriglstein">Simone Kriglstein</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Vienna">University of Vienna, Austria</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a visualization system for gameplay data which can be adapted to different kind of games and queries.

To make sure that a game provides a satisfying experience, a meaningful analysis of gameplay data is crucial, particularly because the quality of a game directly relates to the experience a user gains from playing it. Automatic instrumentation techniques are increasingly used to record data during playtests. However, the evaluation of the data requires strong analytical skills and experience. The visualization of such gameplay data is essentially an information visualization problem, where a large number of variables have to be displayed in a comprehensible way in order to be able to make global judgments. This paper presents a visualization tool to assist the analytical process. It visualizes the game space as a set of nodes which players visit over the course of a game and is also suitable to observe time-dependent information, such as player distribution.  Our tool is not tailored to a specific type of genre. To show the flexibility of our approach we use two different kinds of games as case studies.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208558">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S163_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Jennifer Thom-Santelli, IBM Research, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1818"><a class="title" href="Session163.html#paper1818">A Hybrid Mass Participation Approach to Mobile Software Trials</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Alistair_Morrison">Alistair Morrison</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Glasgow">University of Glasgow, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Donald_McMillan">Donald McMillan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Glasgow">University of Glasgow, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Stuart_Reeves">Stuart Reeves</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nottingham">University of Nottingham, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Scott_Sherwood">Scott Sherwood</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Glasgow">University of Glasgow, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Matthew_Chalmers">Matthew Chalmers</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Glasgow">University of Glasgow, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes methodology for combining simultaneous 'app store' style mobile software trial with local deployment.

Yet from our experiences on these mass participation systems and a survey of the literature, we identify a number of reported difficulties. We propose a hybrid methodology that aims to address these, by combining a global software release with a concurrent local trial. A phone&#8211;based game, created to explore the uptake and use of ad hoc peer-to-peer networking, was evaluated using this new hybrid trial method, combining a small-scale local trial (11 users) with a &#8216;mass participation&#8217; trial (over 10,000 users). Our hybrid method offers many benefits, allowing locally observed findings to be verified, patterns in globally collected data to be explained and addresses ethical issues raised by the mass participation approach. We note trends in the local trial that did not appear in the larger scale deployment, and which would therefore have led to misleading results were the application trialled using &#8216;traditional&#8217; methods alone. Based on this study and previous experience, we provide a set of guidelines to researchers working in this area.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208588">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper242"><a class="title" href="Session163.html#paper242">"Yours is Better!"

Via 450 interviews in Bangalore, India, we measure participant response bias due to interviewer demand characteristics and the role of social and demographic factors in influencing that bias. We find that respondents are about 2.5x more likely to prefer a technological artifact they believe to be developed by the interviewer, even when the alternative is identical. When the interviewer is a foreign researcher requiring a translator, the bias towards the interviewer's artifact increases to 5x. In fact, the interviewer's artifact is preferred even when it is degraded to be obviously inferior to the alternative.

However, cursor interactions are not all the same; different types of cursor behavior patterns exist, such as reading, hesitating, scrolling and clicking, each of which has a different meaning. We conduct a search study with 36 subjects and 32 search tasks to determine when gaze and cursor are aligned, and thus when the cursor position is a good proxy for gaze position. We study the effect of time, behavior patterns, user, and search task on the gaze-cursor alignment, findings which lead us to question the maxim that "gaze is well approximated by cursor." These lessons inform an experiment in which we predict the gaze position with better accuracy than simply using the cursor position, improving the state-of-the-art technique for approximating visual attention with the cursor. Our new technique can help make better use of large-scale cursor data in identifying how users examine Web search pages.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208591">ACM</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="noop"></td><td class="session" id="S152"><span class="type">Paper</span><a class="title" href="Session152.html">Affective Presence</a><span class="room">Room: 17AB</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /><img class="management" src="images/management.png" alt="Community: management" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div></td>

To explore this, we created a heart rate communication probe that was used in two qualitative in-lab studies and a two-week field trial in participants' homes. Results show that heart rate feedback is a strong connectedness cue that affects the interaction in various ways, depending on a number of interrelated factors. In particular, we found two distinct categories of effects: heart rate as information and  heart rate as connection. We propose two mechanisms that could explain these observations and draw out the implications they have for future use of heartbeat communication to support social connectedness or other aspects of social interaction.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208526">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S150_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Shaowen Bardzell, Indiana University, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper232"><a class="title" href="Session150.html#paper232">Personas and Decision Making in the Design Process: An Ethnographic Case Study</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/best.png" class="best" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Erin_Friess">Erin Friess</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_North_Texas">University of North Texas, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>An ethnographic case study that investigates the ways personas are invoked in design decision-making sessions.

However, few studies have ethnographically observed design teams that use personas, and fewer studies have looked specifically at how designers linguistically invoke personas in their decision-making sessions. This discourse analysis of the decision-making sessions of designers at a top tier design firm reveals that although the designers dedicate much time researching, developing, and refining personas, personas themselves make relatively few appearances in the designers&#65533; language during decision-making sessions. This study shows that, for persuasive ends, these designers, who are advocates of personas, routinely use other less precise and more designer-centric linguistic mechanisms in lieu of personas. Despite the scarcity of personas in the decision-making sessions, this ethnographic case study also explores the value of personas for this team even when the personas are not explicitly linguistically invoked.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208572">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1688"><a class="title" href="Session150.html#paper1688">How Do Designers and User Experience Professionals Actually Perceive and Use Personas?</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tara_Matthews">Tara Matthews</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#IBM_Research_-_Almaden">IBM Research - Almaden, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tejinder_K._Judge">Tejinder K.

Prior work has noted challenges in justifying them to developers. In contrast, it has been assumed that designers and user experience professionals--whose goal is to focus designs on targeted users--will readily exploit personas. This paper examines that assumption. We present the first study of how experienced user-centered design (UCD) practitioners with prior experience deploying personas, use and perceive personas in industrial software design. We identify limits to the persona approach in the context studied. Practitioners used personas almost exclusively for communication, but not for design. Participants identified four problems with personas, finding them abstract, impersonal, misleading and distracting. Our findings argue for a new approach to persona deployment and construction. Personas cannot replace immersion in actual user data. And rather than focusing on creating engaging personas, it is critical to avoid persona attributes that mislead or distract.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208573">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs165"><a class="title" href="Session150.html#cs165">Revisiting Personas: The Making-of for Special User Groups</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Christiane_Moser">Christiane Moser</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#ICT&amp;S_Center,_University_of_Salzburg">ICT&amp;S Center, University of Salzburg, Austria</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Verena_Fuchsberger">Verena Fuchsberger</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#ICT&amp;S_Center,_University_of_Salzburg">ICT&amp;S Center, University of Salzburg, Austria</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Katja_Neureiter">Katja Neureiter</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#ICT&amp;S_Center,_University_of_Salzburg">ICT&amp;S Center, University of Salzburg, Austria</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wolfgang_Sellner">Wolfgang Sellner</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#ICT&amp;S_Center,_University_of_Salzburg">ICT&amp;S Center, University of Salzburg, Austria</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Manfred_Tscheligi">Manfred Tscheligi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Salzburg_-_ICT&amp;S">University of Salzburg - ICT&amp;S, Austria</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a decision diagram for the creation of personas and its application.

Because representation is the only medium that learners can use to make sense of imperceptible phenomena, learners encounter challenges when trying to understand the range of imperceptible sizes. However, the conventional visual representations that are incorporated in many learning technologies tend to direct learners to overestimate the sizes of imperceptible objects. To address this issue, we designed a multimodal representation called &#8220;temporal-aural-visual representation (or TAVR) to provide students with an alternative way of perceiving and conceptualizing imperceptible sizes. In prior studies it was noticed that learners constructed more refined mental models of the vast range of imperceptible sizes through the TAVR-enhanced learning activity. In this paper, we introduce a recent study that explored how to best augment the temporal experience of the range of imperceptible sizes with supporting modalities.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208605">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1525"><a class="title" href="Session151.html#paper1525">The Case of the Missed Icon: Change Blindness on Mobile Devices</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Thomas_Davies">Thomas Davies</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_London">University College London, London</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ashweeni_Beeharee">Ashweeni Beeharee</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_London">University College London, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents evidence that change blindness occurs on small displays and is affected by interface designs.

With the proliferation of mobile devices capable of supporting significantly complex applications on small screens, demands on mobile UI design and the user&#65533;s visual system are becoming greater. In this paper, we report results from an empirical study of human visual attention, specifically the Change Blindness phenomenon, on handheld mobile devices and its impact on mobile UI design. It is arguable that due to the small size of the screen - unlike a typical computer monitor - a greater visual coverage of the mobile device is possible, and that these phenomena may occur less frequently during the use of the device, or even that they may not occur at all. Our study shows otherwise. <br /> <br />We tested for Change Blindness (CB) and Inattentional Blindness (IB) in a single-modal, mobile context and attempted to establish factors in the application interface design that induce and/or reduce their occurrences. The results show that both CB and IB can and do occur while using mobile devices. The results also suggest that the number of separate attendable items on-screen is directly proportional to rates of CB. Newly inserted objects were correctly identified more often than changes applied to existing on-screen objects. These results suggest that it is important for mobile UI designers to take these aspects of visual attention into account when designing mobile applications that attempt to deliver information through visual changes or notifications.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208606">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1234"><a class="title" href="Session151.html#paper1234">The Bohemian Bookshelf: Supporting Serendipitous Book Discoveries through Information Visualization</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Alice_Thudt">Alice Thudt</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Munich">University of Munich, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Uta_Hinrichs">Uta Hinrichs</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Calgary">University of Calgary, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sheelagh_Carpendale">Sheelagh Carpendale</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Calgary">University of Calgary, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This paper explores information visualizations as a means to support serendipity based on the case study of the Bohemian Bookshelf, a visualization that was designed to support serendipitous book discoveries.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Serendipity, a trigger of exciting yet unexpected discoveries, is an important but comparatively neglected factor in information seeking, research, and ideation.

In this paper, we investigate how to apply a reactive variant of IFT (Reactive IFT) to design IFT-based tools, with a special focus on such tools for ill-structured problems. Toward this end, we designed and implemented a variety of recommender algorithms to empirically investigate how to help people with the ill-structured problem of finding where to look for information while debugging source code. We varied the algorithms based on scent type supported (words alone vs. words + code structure), and based on use of foraging momentum to estimate rapidity of foragers' goal changes. Our empirical results showed that (1) using both words and code structure significantly improved the ability of the algorithms to recommend where software developers should look for information; (2) participants used recommendations to discover new places in the code and also as shortcuts to navigate to known places; and (3) low-momentum recommendations were significantly more useful than high-momentum recommendations, suggesting rapid and numerous goal changes in this type of setting. Overall, our contributions include two new recommendation algorithms, empirical evidence about when and why participants found IFT-based recommendations useful, and implications for the design of tools based on Reactive IFT. </span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208608">ACM</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="noop"></td><td class="session" id="S155"><span class="type">Case Study &amp; Paper</span><a class="title" href="Session155.html">Games: Community + Communication</a><span class="room">Room: 18AB</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="arts" src="images/arts.png" alt="Community: arts" /><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div></td>

However, experimental evidence is sparse, in part because of difficulties inducing communication online. Moreover, previous work has not identified the route by which communication leads to increased commitment. In this paper, we investigated whether task versus social communication modeled by a leader versus a peer influenced the amount that group members talked and their willingness to continue participating in the group. We conducted an experiment within ad hoc groups in the online game World of Warcraft. Results suggest that communication early in a group&#65533;s history causes members to talk more later on and that the early communication increases their commitment through its influence on group atmosphere rather than through increased member participation. Social communication by a peer is especially valuable in increasing commitment.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208529">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1354"><a class="title" href="Session155.html#paper1354">Twiage: A Game for Finding Good Advice on Twitter</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Max_Van_Kleek">Max Van Kleek</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Southampton">University of Southampton, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Daniel_Smith">Daniel Smith</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Southampton">University of Southampton, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ruben_Stranders">Ruben Stranders</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Southampton">University of Southampton, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#m.c._schraefel">m.c. schraefel</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Southampton">University of Southampton, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Examines the feasibility of crowdsourcing the identification of "useful advice" on Twitter through a Game with a Purpose (GWAP) called Twiage.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Millions of recommendations, opinions and experiences are shared across popular microblogging platforms and services each day. Yet much of this content becomes quickly lost in the stream shortly after being posted.  This paper looks at the feasibility of identifying useful content in microblog streams so that it might be archived to facilitate wider access and reference.  Towards this goal, we present an experiment with a game-with-a-purpose called  <br />\\emph{Twiage} that we designed to determine how well the deluge of content in &#65533;raw&#65533; microblog streams could be turned into filtered and ranked collections using ratings from players.  Experiments with Twiage validate the feasibility of applying human-computation to this problem, finding strong agreement about what constitutes the ``most useful'' content in our test dataset. Second, we compare the effectiveness of various methods of eliciting such ratings, finding that a &#65533;choose-best&#65533; interface and Elo rating ranking scheme yield the greatest agreement in the fewest rounds.  External validation of resulting top-rated twitter content with a domain expert found that while the top Twiage-ranked &#65533;tweets&#65533; were among the best of the set, there was a tendency for players to also select what we term &#65533;weak spam&#65533; -- e.g., promotional content disguised as articles or reviews, indicating a need for more stringent content filtering.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208530">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S153_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Christian Holz, University of Potsdam, Germany</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1152"><a class="title" href="Session153.html#paper1152">Next Steps for Value Sensitive Design</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="management" src="images/management.png" alt="Community: management" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="sustainability" src="images/sustainability.png" alt="Community: sustainability" /></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Alan_Borning">Alan Borning</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michael_Muller">Michael Muller</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#IBM">IBM, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>An essay presenting four suggestions for next steps for the evolution of Value Sensitive Design.

Such questions can be difficult to address well, and a principled approach can clarify issues of both theory and practice.  One such approach is Value Sensitive Design (VSD), an established theory and method for addressing issues of values in a systematic and principled fashion in the design of information technology.  In this essay, we suggest however that the theory and at times the presentation of VSD overclaims in a number of key respects, with the result of inhibiting its more widespread adoption and appropriation.  We address these issues by suggesting four topics for next steps in the evolution of VSD: (1) tempering VSD&#65533;s position on universal values; (2) contextualizing existing and future lists of values that are presented as heuristics for consideration; (3) strengthening the voice of the participants in publications describing VSD investigations; and (4) making clearer the voice of the researchers.  We propose new or altered approaches for VSD that address these issues of theory, voice, and reportage.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208560">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="to110"><a class="title" href="Session153.html#to110">The Relationship of Action Research to Human-Computer Interaction</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">ToCHI</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Gillian_R._Hayes">Gillian R.

Implications concern the role of digital media for collective practice and expression of values.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Design and evaluation of user-generated media production and sharing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) often focus on formal and informal media sharing, such as communication within social networks, automatic notifications of activities, and the exchange of digital artifacts. However, conceptual tools for understanding how people relate to the audiences they reach through these systems are limited. The increasing interest in user-generated content in HCI demands the infusion of new methods and theories that explicitly engage the construction and use of media within and among large groups of individuals and systems. In this paper, we suggest that the notion of &#8220;publics,&#8221; drawn from media theory, provides useful insights into user-driven, social, and cultural forms of technology use and digital content creation. We illustrate this by employing the notion of publics to the findings from a two-month deployment of a mobile photo sharing platform in a youth housing community. The results of this empirical work coupled with a theoretical examination of publics stimulate reflection on prevailing interpretations of user-designer-reader roles. The paper provides an outlook for potentially new and productive ways of understanding interdependencies within those activities. Implications that can be drawn from this work concern the role of digital media creation and sharing for the formation of collectives and how people position themselves collectively in relation to larger social groups and societal norms. The analysis suggests fruitful crossovers among HCI, Media Theory and New Media Research by approaching the user as both consumer and producer of digital content.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper498"><a class="title" href="Session154.html#paper498">Viewpoint: Empowering Communities with Situated Voting Devices</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nick_Taylor">Nick Taylor</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Newcastle_University">Newcastle University, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Justin_Marshall">Justin Marshall</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_Falmouth">University College Falmouth, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Alicia_Blum-Ross">Alicia Blum-Ross</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Surrey">University of Surrey, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#John_Mills">John Mills</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Central_Lancashire">University of Central Lancashire, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jon_Rogers">Jon Rogers</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Dundee">University of Dundee, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Paul_Egglestone">Paul Egglestone</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Central_Lancashire">University of Central Lancashire, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#David_M._Frohlich">David M.

We have also shown how &#65533;motivation&#65533; and &#65533;automation&#65533; have been integrated in e-ESAS and creating a unique motivation-persuasion-motivation cycle where the motivated patients become proactive change agents by persuading others. Though in its early deployment stages (2 months), e-ESAS demonstrates the potential to positively impact the cancer care by (1) helping the doctors with graphical charts of long symptom history (automation), (2) facilitating timely interventions through alert generation (automation) and (3) improving three way communications (doctor-patient-attendant) for a better decision making process (motivation) and thereby improving the quality of life of BC patients.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208532">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1382"><a class="title" href="Session158.html#paper1382">Problems of Data Mobility and Reuse in the Provision of Computer-based Training for Screening Mammography</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mark_Hartswood">Mark Hartswood</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Manchester,_Manchester">University of Manchester, Manchester, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Rob_Procter">Rob Procter</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Manchester">University of Manchester, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Paul_Taylor">Paul Taylor</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_London">University College London, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Lilian_Blot">Lilian Blot</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_York">University of York, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Stuart_Anderson">Stuart Anderson</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mark_Rouncefield">Mark Rouncefield</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Lancaster_University">Lancaster University, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Roger_Slack">Roger Slack</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Bangor_University">Bangor University, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes the problems encountered reusing clinical data to deliver training in breast cancer screening.

We found the communities fall short in supporting the whole person, because  (1) patient expertise and clinical expertise generated by health professionals are shared separately, and (2) patients' quantified data are separate from narrative experiences. Such separation in the design of these systems can lead to limitations in addressing patients' interwoven medical and personal concerns.

For low-income children in developing countries, this task can be significantly more challenging because of lack of access to high-quality schooling, but can potentially improve economic prospects at the same time. A synthesis of research findings suggests that practicing recalling and vocalizing words for expressing an intended meaning could improve word reading skills &#8211; including reading in a second language &#8211; more than silent recognition of what the given words mean. Unfortunately, many language learning software do not support this instructional approach, owing to the technical challenges of incorporating speech recognition support to check that the learner is vocalizing the correct word. In this paper, we present results from a usability test and two subsequent experiments that explore the use of two speech recognition-enabled mobile games to help rural children in India read words with understanding. Through a working speech recognition prototype, we discuss two major contributions of this work: first, we give empirical evidence that shows the extent to which productive training (i.e. vocalizing words) is superior to receptive vocabulary training, and discuss the use of scaffolding hints to &#8220;unpack&#8221; factors in the learner&#8217;s linguistic knowledge that may impact reading. Second, we discuss what our results suggest for future research in HCI.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208564">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1011"><a class="title" href="Session157.html#paper1011">Interactive Visualization for Low Literacy Users: From Lessons Learnt To Design</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Neesha_Kodagoda">Neesha Kodagoda</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Middlesex_University">Middlesex University, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#B_L_William_Wong">B L William Wong</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Middlesex_University">Middlesex University, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chris_Rooney">Chris Rooney</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Middlesex_University">Middlesex University, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nawaz_Khan">Nawaz Khan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Middlesex_University">Middlesex University, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This paper summarizes the problems that low literacy user's face when searching for information online, and establishes a set of design principles for interfaces suitable for low literacy users.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> This paper aims to address the problems low literacy (LL) users face when searching for information online.

Textual tinkerability maps storytelling gestures to changes in animation and text to assist reading exploration and demonstration of the link between text, spoken word, and concept. TinkRBooks are flexible tablet-based storybooks that allow readers to actively explore concepts in text using textual tinkerability. When reading TinkRBooks, both parents and children can alter text (character attributes and parts of speech) by manipulating story elements (props and characters) as they read. We demonstrate how textual tinkerability encourages more dialog, print referencing and dialogic questioning between parent-child dyads in shared reading as compared to paper books. In addition, our study reports observations of storytelling performance behaviors that foster playful and socially intimate shared reading behaviors that are closely mapped to the teaching and learning of emergent literacy skills.</span></div></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S156_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Anthony Hornof, University of Oregon, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="to108"><a class="title" href="Session156.html#to108">Signing on the Tactile Line: A Multimodal System for Teaching Handwriting to Blind Children</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">ToCHI</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Beryl_Plimmer">Beryl Plimmer</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Auckland,_Auckland,_New_Zealand">University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Peter_Reid">Peter Reid</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Auckland">University of Auckland, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Rachel_Blagojevic">Rachel Blagojevic</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Auckland">University of Auckland, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Andrew_Crossan">Andrew Crossan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Glasgow">University of Glasgow, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Stephen_Brewster">Stephen Brewster</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Glasgow,_Glasgow,_United_Kingdom">University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom, </a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>McSig is a multimodal system for teaching blind children to write and draw. Similar combinations of tactile, haptic, sound and stylus interaction could be useful for other non-visual interaction situations.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> We present McSig, a multimodal system for teaching blind children cursive handwriting so that they can create a personal signature. For blind people handwriting is very difficult to learn as it is a near-zero feedback activity that is needed only occasionally, yet in important situations; for example to make an attractive and repeatable signature for legal contracts. McSig aids the teaching of signatures by translating digital ink from the teacher&#8217;s stylus gestures into three non-visual forms: (1) audio pan and pitch represents the x and y movement of the stylus; (2) kinaesthetic information is provided to the student through a force-feedback haptic pen which mimics the teacher&#8217;s stylus movement; (3) a physical tactile line on the writing sheet is created by the haptic pen.  <br />McSig has been developed over two major iterations of design, usability testing and evaluation. The final step of the first iteration was a short evaluation with eight visually impaired children. The results suggested that McSig had the highest potential benefit for congenitally and totally blind children and also indicated some areas where McSig could be enhanced. The second prototype incorporated significant modifications to the system, improving the audio, tactile and force-feedback. We then ran a detailed, longitudinal evaluation over 14 weeks with three of the congenitally blind children to assess McSig&#8217;s effectiveness in teaching the creation of signatures. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of McSig &#8211; they all made considerable progress in learning to create a recognizable signature. By the end of ten lessons two of the children could form a complete, repeatable signature unaided, the third could do so with a little verbal prompting. Furthermore, during this project we have learnt valuable lessons about providing consistent feedback between different communications channels (by manual interactions, haptic device, pen correction) that will be of interest to others developing multimodal systems. </span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper542"><a class="title" href="Session156.html#paper542">Collaboration in Cognitive Tutor Use in Latin America: Field Study and Design Recommendations</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="cci" src="images/cci.png" alt="Community: cci" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Amy_Ogan">Amy Ogan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Erin_Walker">Erin Walker</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Arizona_State_University">Arizona State University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ryan_S.J.d._Baker">Ryan S.J.d.

In particular, cognitive tutoring systems are an example of educational technology that has been ex-tremely effective at improving mathematics learning over traditional classroom instruction. However, studies on the effectiveness of tutor software have been conducted mainly in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, and little is known about how these systems might be used in other contexts with differing classroom practices and values. To understand this question, we studied the usage of mathematics tutoring software for middle school at sites in three Latin American countries: Brazil, Mexico, and Costa Rica. While cognitive tutors were designed for individual use, we found that students in these classrooms worked collaboratively, engaging in interdependently paced work and conducting work away from their own computer. In this paper we present design recommendations for how cognitive tutors might be incorporated into different classroom practices, and better adapted for student needs in these environments.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208597">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs158"><a class="title" href="Session156.html#cs158">Building a Case for M-learning in Africa: African Youth Perspectives on Education</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mokeira_Masita-Mwangi">Mokeira Masita-Mwangi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Research_Center,_Africa">Nokia Research Center, Africa, Kenya</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nancy_Mwakaba">Nancy Mwakaba</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#none">none, Kenya</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Faith_Ronoh-Boreh">Faith Ronoh-Boreh</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Research_Center,_Africa">Nokia Research Center, Africa, Kenya</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jussi_Impio">Jussi Impio</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Research_Center,_Africa">Nokia Research Center, Africa, Kenya</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>The paper provides valuable insights into African youth in terms of education challenges and opportunities hence inspiring and informing research and development of technologies for Africa particularly for m-learning.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> This paper is based on a case study of six African countries. It takes a look at education challenges faced by African youth and the gaps that exist in the education systems. African youth have the potential to be frontrunners in socio-economic transformation in the continent. They need to be empowered to be able to play their part. The huge gaps between education policy and practice, and other problems in this sector leave many African youth out of the system. Information and communication technology (ICT) is being integrated in education in many African countries. The emphasis has been on equipping schools with computers and literacy of the same. However the progress and impact is minimal due to inadequate resources, infrastructural challenges and lack of capacity. Mobile phone penetration in the continent has increased phenomenally unlike ownership of personal computers. This paper therefore proposes m-learning using mobile phones as a logical and viable channel of delivering education to African youth.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1608"><a class="title" href="Session156.html#paper1608">Evaluating the Implicit Acquisition of Second Language Vocabulary Using a Live Wallpaper</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#David_Dearman">David Dearman</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Research_Center">Nokia Research Center, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Khai_N_Truong">Khai N Truong</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Using a novel language learning interfaces (called Vocabulary Wallpaper) we explore if second language vocabulary can be implicitly acquired through a user&#8217;s explicit interactions with her mobile phone.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> An essential aspect of learning a second language is the acquisition of vocabulary. However, acquiring vocabulary is often a protracted process that requires repeated and spaced exposure; which can be difficult to accommodate given the busyness of daily living. In this paper, we explore if a learner can implicitly acquire second language vocabulary through her explicit interactions with her mobile phone (e.g., navigating multiple home screens) using an interface we developed called Vocabulary Wallpaper. In addition, we examine if the type of vocabulary this technique exposes to the learner, whether it is contextually relevant or contextually-independent will influence the learner&#8217;s rate of vocabulary acquisition. The results of our study show participants were able to use Vocabulary Wallpaper to increase the number of second language vocabulary that they can recognize and recall and their rate of vocabulary acquisition was significantly greater when presented with a contextually relevant vocabulary than a contextually-independent vocabulary.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208598">ACM</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="noop"></td><td class="session" id="S147"><span class="type">Case Study &amp; Paper</span><a class="title" href="Session147.html">It's a Big Web!</a><span class="room">Room: 19AB</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div></td>

In this paper, we study Google+, which enables users to selectively share content with specific &#65533;Circles&#65533; of people. Through a combination of log analysis with surveys and interviews, we investigate how active users organize and select audiences for shared content. We find that these users frequently engaged in selective sharing, creating circles to manage content across particular life facets, ties of varying strength, and interest-based groups. Motivations to share spanned personal and informational reasons, and users frequently weighed &#65533;limiting&#65533; factors (e.g. privacy, relevance, and social norms) against the desire to reach a large audience. Our work identifies implications for the design of selective sharing mechanisms in social networks.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208552">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper282"><a class="title" href="Session147.html#paper282">Omnipedia: Bridging the Wikipedia Language Gap</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Patti_Bao">Patti Bao</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Northwestern_University">Northwestern University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Brent_Hecht">Brent Hecht</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Northwestern_University">Northwestern University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Samuel_Carton">Samuel Carton</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Northwestern_University">Northwestern University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mahmood_Quaderi">Mahmood Quaderi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Northwestern_University">Northwestern University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michael_S._Horn">Michael S.

We detail solutions to numerous front-end and algorithmic challenges inherent to providing users with a multilingual Wikipedia experience. These include visualizing content in a language-neutral way and aligning data in the face of diverse information organization strategies. We present a study of Omnipedia that characterizes how people interact with information using a multilingual lens. We found that users actively sought information exclusive to unfamiliar language editions and strategically compared how language editions defined concepts.

Current practice is anchored on the assumption that faces and names draw attention; the same presentation format is used independently of the social connection strength and the search query topic. The key findings of our experiments indicate room for improvement. First, only certain social contacts are useful sources of information, depending on the search topic. Second, faces lose their well-documented power to draw attention when rendered small as part of a social search result annotation. Third, and perhaps most surprisingly, social annotations go largely unnoticed by users in general due to selective, structured visual parsing behaviors specific to search result pages. We conclude by recommending improvements to the design and content of social annotations to make them more noticeable and useful. </span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208554">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs103"><a class="title" href="Session147.html#cs103">Designing for a Billion Users:  A Case Study of Facebook</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Parmit_Chilana">Parmit Chilana</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington_(UW)">University of Washington (UW), USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Christina_Holsberry">Christina Holsberry</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Facebook,_Inc">Facebook, Inc, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Flavio_Oliveira">Flavio Oliveira</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Facebook">Facebook, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Andrew_Ko">Andrew Ko</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>A case study of what it is like to design for a billion users at Facebook.

We conclude by discussing some of the issues that have been highlighted when attempting apply this approach in different design contexts and the issues that have been raised when working with partners who are less committed to the idea of engaging with older adults in participatory design.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208570">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S160_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Ian Li, Carnegie Mellon University, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1102"><a class="title" href="Session160.html#paper1102">ShutEye: Encouraging Awareness of Healthy Sleep Recommendations with a Mobile, Peripheral Display</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jared_S_Bauer">Jared S Bauer</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sunny_Consolvo">Sunny Consolvo</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Benjamin_Greenstein">Benjamin Greenstein</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Google">Google, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jonathan_Schooler">Jonathan Schooler</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eric_Wu">Eric Wu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nathaniel_F_Watson">Nathaniel F Watson</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Univeristy_of_Washington">Univeristy of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Julie_A_Kientz">Julie A Kientz</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a field study of an application for mobile phones that uses a peripheral display to promote healthy sleep habits.

However, 40 million people in the U.S. are diagnosed with sleep disorders, with many more undiagnosed. To help address this problem, we developed an application, ShutEye, which provides a peripheral display on the wall-paper of the user's mobile phone to promote awareness about recommended activities that promote good sleep quality. Based on preferences about the user's desired bed-time and activities' for example, consuming caffeine or performing vigorous exercise. ShutEye displays guidance about when engaging in those activities is likely to affect sleep without requiring any explicit interaction from the user. In this paper, we describe ShutEye and results from a four-week field study with 12 participants. Results indicate that a simple, recommendation-based peripheral display can be a very low-effort but still effective method for improving awareness of healthy sleep habits. We also provide recommendations about designing peripheral displays and extend insights for designing health-based mobile applications.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208600">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper789"><a class="title" href="Session160.html#paper789">Using Mobile Phones to Present Medical Information to Hospital Patients</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Laura_Pfeifer_Vardoulakis">Laura Pfeifer Vardoulakis</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Northeastern_University">Northeastern University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Amy_Karlson">Amy Karlson</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Dan_Morris">Dan Morris</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Greg_Smith">Greg Smith</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Justin_Gatewood">Justin Gatewood</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#MedStar_Institute_for_Innovation">MedStar Institute for Innovation, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Desney_Tan">Desney Tan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We provided 25 emergency department patients with a mobile phone interface to near-real-time data about their care.

To better understand the unique affordances that mobile devices offer in the hospital setting, we provided twenty-five patients with mobile phones that presented a dynamic, interactive report on their progress, care plan, and care team throughout their emergency department stay. Through interviews with these patients, their visitors, and hospital staff, we explore the benefits and challenges of using the mobile phone as an information display, finding overall that this is a promising approach to improving patient awareness.

One way of using the 3D space above a horizontal surface is to divide it into discrete parallel layers stacked upon each other. Horizontal and vertical lens movements are essential tasks for the style of multi-layer interaction associated with it. We conducted a comprehensive user study with 18 participants investigating fundamental issues such as optimal number of layers and their thickness, movement and holding accuracies, and physical boundaries of the interaction volume. Findings include a rather limited overall interaction height (44 cm), a different minimal layer thickness for vertical and horizontal search tasks (1 cm/4 cm), a reasonable maximum number of layers depending on the primary task, and a convenience zone in the middle for horizontal search. Derived from that, design guidelines are also presented.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208583">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper488"><a class="title" href="Session142.html#paper488">A Comparative Evaluation of Finger and Pen Stroke Gestures</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Huawei_Tu">Huawei Tu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Kochi_University_of_Technology">Kochi University of Technology, Japan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Xiangshi_Ren">Xiangshi Ren</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Kochi_University_of_Technology">Kochi University of Technology, Japan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Shumin_Zhai">Shumin Zhai</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Google_Research">Google Research, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>First study investigating the differences and similarities between finger and pen gestures.

Our findings were as follows: (1) Finger drawn gestures were quite different to pen drawn gestures in basic measures including size ratio and average speed. Finger drawn gestures tended to be larger and faster than pen drawn gestures. They also differed in shape geometry as measured by, for example, aperture of closed gestures, corner shape distance and intersecting points deviation; (2) Pen drawn gestures and finger drawn gestures were similar in several measures including articulation time, indicative angle difference, axial symmetry and proportional shape distance; (3) There were interaction effects between gesture implement (finger vs. pen) and target gesture size and gesture complexity. Our findings show that half of the features we tested were performed well enough by the finger. This finding suggests that "finger friendly" systems should exploit these features when designing finger interfaces and avoid using the other features in which the finger does not perform as well as the pen.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208584">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper131"><a class="title" href="Session142.html#paper131">A Handle Bar Metaphor for Virtual Object Manipulation with Mid-Air Interaction</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Peng_Song">Peng Song</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nanyang_Technological_University">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wooi_Boon_Goh">Wooi Boon Goh</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nanyang_Technological_University">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#William_Hutama">William Hutama</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nanyang_Technological_University">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chi-Wing_Fu">Chi-Wing Fu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nanyang_Technological_University">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Xiaopei_Liu">Xiaopei Liu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nanyang_Technological_University,_Singapore">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed to realise a suite of intuitive and highly-controllable mid-air interaction for manipulating single/multiple virtual 3D objects with low-resolution depth sensors like Kinect </div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Commercial 3D scene acquisition systems such as the Microsoft Kinect sensor can reduce the cost barrier of realizing mid-air interaction. However, since it can only sense hand position but not hand orientation robustly, current mid-air interaction methods for 3D virtual object manipulation often require contextual and mode switching to perform translation, rotation, and scaling, thus preventing natural continuous gestural interactions. A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed as an effective visual control metaphor between the user's hand gestures and the corresponding virtual object manipulation operations. It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to design the mid-air interaction allows us to provide precise controllability despite the Kinect sensor's low image resolution. A comprehensive repertoire of 3D manipulation operations is proposed to manipulate single objects, perform fast constrained rotation, and pack/align multiple objects along a line. Three user studies were devised to demonstrate the efficacy and intuitiveness of the proposed interaction techniques on different virtual manipulation scenarios.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208585">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper104"><a class="title" href="Session142.html#paper104">Fly: Studying Recall, Macrostructure Understanding, and User Experience of Canvas Presentations</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Leonhard_Lichtschlag">Leonhard Lichtschlag</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Thomas_Hess">Thomas Hess</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Thorsten_Karrer">Thorsten Karrer</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jan_Borchers">Jan Borchers</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents a user study to investigate the effect of the canvas presentation format on recall, macrostructure understanding, and user experience.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Most presentation software uses the slide deck metaphor to create visual presentation support.

However, expert knowledge is often lacking in such markets, making it impossible to complete certain classes of tasks. In this work we introduce an alternative mechanism for crowdsourcing tasks that require specialized knowledge or skill: communitysourcing --- the use of physical kiosks to elicit work from specific populations. We investigate the potential of communitysourcing by designing, implementing and evaluating Umati: the communitysourcing vending machine. Umati allows users to earn credits by performing tasks using a touchscreen attached to the machine. Physical rewards (in this case, snacks) are dispensed through traditional vending mechanics. We evaluated whether communitysourcing can accomplish expert work by using Umati to grade Computer Science exams. We placed Umati in a university Computer Science building, targeting students with grading tasks for snacks. Over one week, 328 unique users (302 of whom were students) completed 7771 tasks (7240 by students). 80% of users had never participated in a crowdsourcing market before. We found that Umati was able to grade exams with 2% higher accuracy (at the same price) or at 33% lower cost (at equivalent accuracy) than traditional single-expert grading. Mechanical Turk workers had no success grading the same exams. These results indicate that communitysourcing can successfully elicit high-quality expert work from specific communities.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208619">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper564"><a class="title" href="Session148.html#paper564">LemonAid: Selection-Based Crowdsourced Contextual Help for Web Applications</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Parmit_K._Chilana">Parmit K.

SocialProof begins with the output produced by ASR engines and enhances this output using the power of crowd intelligence via MTurk service. Our system splits one ASR dictation scenario into several smaller tasks, allowing multiple people to work on different pieces of the task at the same time. Data merging strategies are used to combine multiple responses from MTurk workers to provide improved results. An evaluation of SocialProof strongly supports the effectiveness of this approach.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="sr117"><a class="title" href="Session36.html#sr117">A Framework for Interactive Paper-craft System</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Student Research Competition</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Kening_Zhu">Kening Zhu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Keio-NUS_CUTE_Center">Keio-NUS CUTE Center, Singapore</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>In this paper I present three main characteristics for paper-computing system, as an initial framework for designing paper-computing interaction, with two supportive technologies: natural-feature-based origami recognition and selective inductive power transferring.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Paper, as a tradition medium for art and communication, shows great potential as a good candidate for organic user interface (OUI), with its intrinsic deformability and flexibility.

It does so by matching each message with a corresponding screenshot of the application. ScreenMatch consists of a tool to gather screenshots, an algorithm to match messages to screenshots, and an interface that presents translators with screenshots alongside messages. We evaluated the system by gathering screenshots for 3 applications, using the algorithm to match messages to screenshots, and comparing results to manual matches. We found that hard-to-reproduce error messages make it difficult to gather all the screenshots.

Moreover, our tools, interactions, and infrastructures are tied intimately to human flourishing. In this SIGCHI Social Impact Award talk, I seek to inspire the CHI community to engage with socially significant issues. This talk will be a combination of personal reflections on building theory and method over a 20-year period, and a synthesis of core framings in value sensitive design. Along the way, I will dwell on method, examining roughly a dozen value sensitive design methods that taken as a whole can help researchers and designers account for human values in their technical endeavors. In so doing, I will expand the HCI design space beyond technical devices to infrastructure, policy, and social norms. Key to my discussion will be attention to the challenges of scale &#8211; across time, geography, cultures, and stakeholders. From method, I will make the turn to multi-lifespan information system design and concentrate my talk on the first project under that program &#8211; the Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal which supports peace-building and reconciliation in the aftermath of widespread violence. I will close this talk with openings: open questions in value sensitive and multi-lifespan information system design; and, more broadly, open challenges for the HCI community as we imagine the tools, interactions, and infrastructures that will underlie the futures of societies. We set our sights on progress, not perfection. <br /> <br />Biography Batya Friedman is a Professor in the Information School, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science, and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington where she directs the Value Sensitive Design Research Lab. Batya pioneered value sensitive design (VSD), an approach to account for human values in the design of information systems. First developed in human-computer interaction, VSD has since been used in information management, human-robotic interaction, computer security, civil engineering, applied philosophy, and land use and transportation. Her work has focused on a wide range of values, some include privacy in public, trust, freedom from bias, moral agency, sustainability, safety, calmness, freedom of expression, and human dignity; along with a range of technologies such as web browsers, urban simulation, robotics, open source tools, mobile computing, implantable medical devices, computer security, ubiquitous computing and computing infrastructure. She is currently working on multi-lifespan information system design and on methods for envisioning &#8211; new ideas for leveraging information systems to shape our futures. Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal is an early project in this multi-lifespan information system design program. Batya received both her B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.</span></div></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S37_details"><div class="submissionDetails" id="sd109"><a class="title" href="Session37.html#sd109">Shoji: Communicating Privacy</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Student Design Competition</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Caroline_Laroche_Lortie">Caroline Laroche Lortie</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Universit&#233;_Laval">Universit&#233; Laval, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Benoit_Rochon">Benoit Rochon</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Universit&#233;_Laval">Universit&#233; Laval, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Serge_Pelletier">Serge Pelletier</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Universit&#233;_Laval">Universit&#233; Laval, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jo&#235;lle_Sasseville">Jo&#235;lle Sasseville</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Universit&#233;_Laval">Universit&#233; Laval, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>A shared living space entails certain privacy issues, making communication between roommates a prime factor of the domestic experience.

Much research has been conducted into helping couples overcome the problems associated with long distance relationships (LDRs) and many steps have been made towards solving it through enabling them to keep in contact via video, audio, or visual artifacts. Our approach supplements these traditional communication mediums by exploiting &#8220;touch&#8221; &#8211; a sensation that is dominant in almost every relationship. We designed, built and tested a prototype touch device, with the intention of bringing couples closer together during a regular Skype conversation, by allowing each to feel the other&#8217;s touch. Our study showed that participants found touching each other in this way was intriguing, enabling them to feel the other person&#8217;s hand touching theirs at a distance, and in doing so bridging the distance between them.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="sd150"><a class="title" href="Session37.html#sd150">Habitag: Virtually Home</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Student Design Competition</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Hsein_Chin,_Samuel_Heng">Hsein Chin, Samuel Heng</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_University_of_Singapore">National University of  Singapore, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jianxiong,_Kevin_Lin">Jianxiong, Kevin Lin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_University_of_Singapore">National University of  Singapore, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Teng_Chek_Lim">Teng Chek Lim</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_University_of_Singapore">National University of  Singapore, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Kaili_Agatha_Soh">Kaili Agatha Soh</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_University_of_Singapore">National University of  Singapore, Singapore</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Habitag is a prototype design trying to solve a problem newlyweds may face when planning for their lives together.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> In Singapore, many young adults do not move out of their family home even after marriage.

These are mostly time related or because of overacted cautiousness. The interviews further showed that gift-giving often improves relationships and enables communication. These findings led to a couple of design ideas of which we chose the most promising to investigate further. Our final solution was a concept of a mobile agent ``SharryBot'' which can distribute gifts among the neighborhood and thereby connecting people in an effective way.

Displacement of pets after disaster events is a serious matter to families and for public safety at large. People are not willing to evacuate without their non-human family members; many will break through evacuation zones to recover animals left behind. In the 2005 Hurricane Katrina event, over 200,000 pets were displaced, and 95% of them were never reunited with their families. The US Department of Agriculture confirms that the problem of reuniting displaced pets and their guardians at this scale is unfortunately common in disaster events. We introduce No Place Like Home, a socially networked web and mobile platform that facilitates reunification of non-human with human family members following disaster events. No Place Like Home is an effort that supports the formation of small cadres of micro-tasking &#8220;digital volunteers&#8221; that converge after disasters to do photo- and description-matching; employs a reputation and reward system to encourage use; and uses match-based machine learning techniques to accelerate the manual matching tasks performed by digital volunteers.</span></div></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S7_details"><div class="submissionDetails" id="pl108"><a class="title" href="Session7.html#pl108">Invited Panel: Managing UX Teams: Insights from Executive Leaders</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Panel</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Janice_A_Rohn">Janice A Rohn</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Experian">Experian, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Dennis_Wixon">Dennis Wixon</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft">Microsoft, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Dan_Rosenberg">Dan Rosenberg</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#SAP_Labs">SAP Labs, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jeremy_Ashley">Jeremy Ashley</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Oracle">Oracle, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Larry_Tesler">Larry Tesler</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Larry_Tesler,_Consultant">Larry Tesler, Consultant, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Lively interviews of well-known executive leaders in User Experience, discussing their experiences with building and managing teams, their advice on best practices, and their vision for the future.   </div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> A number of well-known corporations were earlier adopters of creating and building User Experience departments, which has resulted in a small set of executive leaders in User Experience who have decades of corporate User Experience management experience.

Although exceedingly simple in their output - varying light intensity over time - their design space can be rich. Unfortunately, a survey of contemporary uses revealed that the vocabulary of lighting expression in popular use today is small, fairly unimaginative, and generally ambiguous in meaning. In this paper, we work through a structured design process that points the way towards a much richer set of expressive forms and more effective communication for this very simple medium. In this process, we make use of five different data gathering and evaluation components to leverage the knowledge, opinions and expertise of people outside our team. Our work starts by considering what information is typically conveyed in this medium. We go on to consider potential expressive forms - how information might be conveyed. We iteratively refine and expand these sets, concluding with ideas gathered from a panel of designers. Our final step was to make use of thousands of human judgments, gathered in a crowd-sourced fashion (265 participants), to measure the suitability of different expressive forms for conveying different information content. This results in a set of recommended light behaviors that mobile devices, such as smartphones, could readily employ.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208296">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1280"><a class="title" href="Session164.html#paper1280">Virtual Projection: Exploring Optical Projection as a Metaphor for Multi-Device Interaction</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Dominikus_Baur">Dominikus Baur</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Munich_LMU">University of Munich LMU, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sebastian_Boring">Sebastian Boring</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Calgary">University of Calgary, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Steven_Feiner">Steven Feiner</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Columbia">Columbia, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes the concept of virtualizing optical projections as a metaphor for interacting between handhelds and stationary displays.

We present virtual projection (VP), an interaction metaphor inspired by how we intuitively control the position, size, and orientation of a handheld optical projector&#65533;s image. VP is based on tracking a handheld device without an optical projector and allows selecting a target display on which to position, scale, and orient an item in a single gesture. By relaxing the optical projection metaphor, we can deviate from modeling perspective projection, for example, to con-strain scale or orientation, create multiple copies, or offset the image. VP also supports dynamic filtering based on the projection frustum, creating overview and detail applications, and selecting portions of a larger display for zooming and panning. We show exemplary use cases implemented using our optical feature-tracking framework and present the results of a user study demonstrating the effectiveness of VP in complex interactions with large displays.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208297">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1882"><a class="title" href="Session164.html#paper1882">Creating and Using Interactive Narratives: Reading and Writing Branching Comics</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="arts" src="images/arts.png" alt="Community: arts" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Daniel_Andrews">Daniel Andrews</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Birmingham">University of Birmingham, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chris_Baber">Chris Baber</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Birmingham">University of Birmingham, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sergey_Efremov">Sergey Efremov</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Moscow_State_Institute_of_Electronics_and_Mathematics">Moscow State Institute of Electronics and Mathematics, Russian Federation</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mikhail_Komarov">Mikhail Komarov</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Moscow_State_Institute_of_Electronics_and_Mathematics_(Technical_University)">Moscow State Institute of Electronics and Mathematics (Technical University), Russia</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes the design and development of a novel form of interactive, multi-touch comics, which can facilitate the authoring of, and engagement with, interactive narratives.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> In this paper we describe the design and development of a multi-touch surface and software that challenges current approaches to the production and consumption of comics.

In terms of the impact this has upon the experience of reading and writing, the implementation of paper is intended to facilitate the creation of high-level overviews of stories, while the touch surface allows users to generate branches through the addition of artifacts in accordance with certain theories about interactive narratives.

In this paper, we use the human body as an antenna for sensing whole-body gestures.

These displays provide new functionalities such as personalized views for multiple users, privacy protection, and stereoscopic 3D displays. However, current multi-view displays rely on special hardware, thus significantly limiting their availability to consumers and adoption in everyday scenarios. In this paper, we present a pure software solution (i.e. with no hardware modification) that allows us to present two independent views concurrently on the most widely used and affordable type of LCD screen, namely Twisted Nematic (TN). We achieve this by exploiting a technical limitation of the technology which causes these LCDs to show varying brightness and color depending on the viewing angle. We describe our technical solution as well as demonstrate example applications in everyday scenarios.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208369">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1562"><a class="title" href="Session187.html#paper1562">Ultra-Tangibles: Creating Movable Tangible Objects on Interactive Tables</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mark_T_Marshall">Mark T Marshall</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Thomas_Carter">Thomas Carter</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jason_Alexander">Jason Alexander</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Lancaster_University">Lancaster University, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sriram_Subramanian">Sriram Subramanian</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents a system that uses ultrasound-based air pressure waves to move multiple tangible objects, independently, around an interactive surface.

A virtual image of a 3D scene is rendered through a half silvered mirror and spatially aligned with the real-world for the viewer. Users easily reach into an interaction volume displaying the virtual image. This allows the user to literally get their hands into the virtual display and to directly interact with an spatially aligned 3D virtual world, without the need for any specialized head-worn hardware or input device. We introduce a new technique for interpreting raw Kinect data to approximate and track rigid (e.g., books, cups) and non-rigid (e.g., hands, paper) physical objects and support a variety of physics-inspired interactions between virtual and real. In particular the algorithm models natural human grasping of virtual objects with more fidelity than previously demonstrated. A qualitative study highlights rich emergent 3D interactions, using hands and real-world objects. The implementation of HoloDesk is described in full, and example application scenarios explored. Finally, HoloDesk is quantitatively evaluated in a 3D target acquisition task, comparing the system with indirect and glasses-based variants.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208405">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1073"><a class="title" href="Session180.html#paper1073">DisplayStacks: Interaction Techniques for Stacks of Flexible Thin-Film Displays</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Audrey_Girouard">Audrey Girouard</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carleton_University">Carleton University, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Aneesh_P_Tarun">Aneesh P Tarun</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Human_Media_Lab,_Queen's_University">Human Media Lab, Queen's University, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Roel_Vertegaal">Roel Vertegaal</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Human_Media_Lab,_Queen's_University">Human Media Lab, Queen's University, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents DisplayStacks, a paper computer that allows physical stacking of digital documents via piles of thin-film flexible E Ink displays, with associated interaction techniques.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Stacking physical documents is one of the main forms of spatio-temporal organization of information.

The depth increase can be seen in the seriousness with which HCI takes complex, subjective dimensions of interaction, such as affect, identity, experience, aesthetics.

Based on an online survey with 470 participants, the results reveal a highly significant impact of five characteristics that corporate career presences provide both a hedonic as well as a utilitarian value to the user.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208408">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1573"><a class="title" href="Session188.html#paper1573">Finding and Assessing Social Media Information Sources in the Context of Journalism</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nicholas_Diakopoulos">Nicholas Diakopoulos</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Rutgers_University">Rutgers University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Munmun_De_Choudhury">Munmun De Choudhury</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Rutgers_University">Rutgers University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mor_Naaman">Mor Naaman</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Rutgers_University">Rutgers University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Design and evaluation of a system for journalists to filter and assess the verity of sources found through social media, including eyewitness, user-archetype classifiers, and network and location cues.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Social media is already a fixture for reporting for many journalists, especially around breaking news events where non-professionals may already be on the scene to share an eyewitness report, photo, or video of the event. At the same time, the huge amount of content posted in conjunction with such events serves as a challenge to finding interesting and trustworthy sources in the din of the stream. In this paper we develop and investigate new methods for filtering and assessing the verity of sources found through social media by journalists. We take a human centered design approach to developing a system, SRSR ("Seriously Rapid Source Review"), informed by journalistic practices and knowledge of information production in events. We then used the system, together with a realistic reporting scenario, to evaluate the filtering and visual cue features that we developed. Our evaluation offers insights into social media information sourcing practices and challenges, and highlights the role technology can play in the solution.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208409">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs167"><a class="title" href="Session188.html#cs167">Evaluation of the Uses and Benefits of a Social Business Platform</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="management" src="images/management.png" alt="Community: management" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Lester_Holtzblatt">Lester Holtzblatt</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#The_MITRE_Corporation">The MITRE Corporation, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jill_Drury">Jill Drury</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#MITRE_Corporation">MITRE Corporation, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Daniel_Weiss">Daniel Weiss</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#The_MITRE_Corporation">The MITRE Corporation, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Laurie_Damianos">Laurie Damianos</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#The_MITRE_Corporation">The MITRE Corporation, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Donna_Cuomo">Donna Cuomo</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#The_MITRE_Corporation,_Bedford">The MITRE Corporation, Bedford, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This case study evaluates how knowledge workers within a corporation use and benefit from using a social business platform and how different patterns of staff activities impact their experienced benefits.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> We evaluated an integrated social software platform, called Handshake, to determine individuals&#8217; usage patterns and characterize Handshake&#8217;s business value.

However, it is unclear how useful different types of information are for people to make expertise judgments and to what extent their background knowledge influences their judgments. This study explored differences between experts and novices in inferring expertise of Twitter users. In three conditions, participants rated the level of expertise of users after seeing (1) only the tweets, (2) only the contextual information including short biographical and user list information, and (3) both tweets and contextual information. Results indicated that, in general, contextual information provides more useful information for making expertise judgment of Twitter users than tweets. While the addition of tweets seems to make little difference, or even add nuances to novices&#65533; expertise judgment, experts&#65533; judgments were improved when both content and contextual information were presented.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208410">ACM</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="noop"></td><td class="session" id="S165"><span class="type">Paper</span><a class="title" href="Session165.html">Sensing + Sensible Interaction</a><span class="room">Room: Ballroom G</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="arts" src="images/arts.png" alt="Community: arts" /></div><div class="best"><img src="images/nominee.png"></div></td>

Guideline for developers to collect training data for gesture recognition systems that achieve correctness and coverage.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Entertainment and gaming systems such as the Wii and XBox Kinect have brought touchless, body-movement based interfaces to the masses. Systems like these enable the estimation of movements of various body parts from raw inertial motion or depth sensor data. However, the interface developer is still left with the challenging task of creating a system that recognizes these movements as embodying meaning. The machine learning approach for tackling this problem requires the collection of data sets that contain the relevant body movements and their associated semantic labels. These data sets directly impact the accuracy and performance of the gesture recognition system and should ideally contain all natural variations of the movements associated with a gesture. This paper addresses the problem of collecting such gesture datasets. In particular, we investigate the question of what is the  most appropriate semiotic modality of instructions for conveying to human subjects the movements the system developer needs them to perform. The results of our qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate that the choice of modality has a significant impact on the performance of the learnt gesture recognition system; particularly in terms of correctness and coverage.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208303">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1019"><a class="title" href="Session165.html#paper1019">Making Gestural Input from Arm-Worn Inertial Sensors More Practical</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Louis_Kratz">Louis Kratz</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Drexel_University">Drexel University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Daniel_Morris">Daniel Morris</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#T._Scott_Saponas">T.

The associated motor and cognitive costs can be high. We argue that proper and consistent mechanisms to support undo in this context are lacking, and present Dwell-and-Spring, an interaction technique that uses the metaphor of springs to enable users to undo direct manipulations. A spring widget pops up whenever the user dwells during a press-drag-release interaction, giving her the opportunity to either cancel the current manipulation or undo the last one. The technique is generic and can easily be implemented on top of existing applications to complement the traditional undo command.

WindowScape was intended to provide a more flexible and intuitive grouping model than prior systems. We report on the design process leading up to the system, and alternative designs we explored. We describe a series of formative evaluations that resulted in significant modifications to our initial prototype, as well as a deployment study of the final version, where users lived with WindowScape on a day-to-day basis. Our results from this study reveal how users react to novel aspects of our system, including its particular uses of miniaturization and its approach to grouping. We also discuss the impact of a task-oriented approach to window management on other aspects of user behavior, and the implications of this for future system design.</span></div></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S181_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Ken Hinckley, Microsoft Research, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1158"><a class="title" href="Session181.html#paper1158">iRotate: Automatic Screen Rotation based on Face Orientation</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Lung-Pan_Cheng">Lung-Pan Cheng</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_Taiwan_University">National Taiwan University, Taiwan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Fang-I_Hsiao">Fang-I Hsiao</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_Taiwan_University">National Taiwan University, Taiwan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Yen-Ting_Liu">Yen-Ting Liu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_Taiwan_University">National Taiwan University, Taiwan</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mike_Y._Chen">Mike Y.

For users with visual impairment, or when occupied with another task that requires a user's visual attention, these phones can be difficult to use. Recently, marks initiating from the bezel, the physical touch-insensitive frame surrounding a touchscreen display, have been proposed as a method for eyes-free interaction. Due to the physical form factor of the mobile device, it is possible to access different parts of the bezel eyes-free. In this paper, we first studied the performance of different bezel menu layouts. Based on the results, we designed a bezel-based text entry application to gain insights into how bezel menus perform in a real-world application. From a longitudinal study, we found that the participants achieved 9.2 words per minute in situations requiring minimal visual attention to the screen. After only one hour of practice, the participants transitioned from novice to expert users. This shows that bezel menus can be adopted for realistic applications.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208376">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1607"><a class="title" href="Session181.html#paper1607">Determining the Orientation of Proximate Mobile Devices using their Back Facing Camera</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#David_Dearman">David Dearman</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Research_Center">Nokia Research Center, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Richard_T_Guy">Richard T Guy</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Khai_N_Truong">Khai N Truong</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Novel method to determine the relative orientation or proximate mobile device using only their backside camera.

We implemented this method as a service called Orienteer, which provides mobile device with the orientation of other proximate mobile devices. We demonstrate that orientation information can be used to enable novel and natural interactions by developing two applications that allow the user to push content in the direction of another device to share it and point the device toward another to filter content based on the device&#8217;s owner. An informal evaluation revealed that interactions built upon orientation information can be natural and compelling to users, but developers and designers need to carefully consider how orientation should be applied effectively.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208377">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper231"><a class="title" href="Session181.html#paper231">Phone as a Pixel: Enabling Ad-Hoc, Large-Scale Displays Using Mobile Devices</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Julia_Schwarz">Julia Schwarz</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#David_Klionsky">David Klionsky</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chris_Harrison">Chris Harrison</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Paul_Dietz">Paul Dietz</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft">Microsoft, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Andrew_D._Wilson">Andrew D.

This approach has several advantages: devices can be arbitrarily arranged (i.e., not in a grid) and infrastructure consists of a single conventional camera. Further, additional devices can join at any time without re-calibration. These are desirable properties to enable collective displays in contexts like sporting events, concerts and political rallies.

An unimplemented design change can be evaluated by perturbing a Tome task model in CogTool to reflect the change, giving a new performance prediction.

Research in the area falls into two broad categories: the micro world of perception and cognition; and the macro world of organisations, systems and long-term planning. Although both kinds of research have generated insights into behaviour, the data generated by the two kinds of research have been effectively incommensurable. Designing safer and more efficient interactions in interrupted and multitasking environments requires that researchers in the area attempt to bridge the gap between these worlds. This SIG aims to stimulate discussion of the tools and methods we need as a community in order to further our understanding of interruptions and multitasking.</span></div></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S35_details"><div class="submissionDetails" id="si115"><a class="title" href="Session35.html#si115">SIG: End-User Programming</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">SIG Meeting</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Christopher_Scaffidi">Christopher Scaffidi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Oregon_State_University">Oregon State University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Joel_Brandt">Joel Brandt</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Adobe_Systems">Adobe Systems, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Margaret_Burnett">Margaret Burnett</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Oregon_State_University">Oregon State University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Andrew_Dove">Andrew Dove</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_Instruments">National Instruments, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Brad_A._Myers">Brad A.

'Envisioning', a characteristic future-oriented technique for design thinking, often features as significant part of our research processes in the field. This paper compares, contrasts and critiques the varied ways in which envisionings have been used within ubiquitous computing and traces their relationships to other, different envisionings, such as those of virtual reality. In unpacking envisioning, it argues primarily that envisioning should be foregrounded as a significant concern and interest within HCI. Foregrounding envisioning's frequent mix of fiction, forecasting and extrapolation, the paper recommends changes in the way we read, interpret and use envisionings through taking into account issues such as context and intended audience.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208278">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1727"><a class="title" href="Session171.html#paper1727">Steampunk as Design Fiction</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="arts" src="images/arts.png" alt="Community: arts" /><img class="sustainability" src="images/sustainability.png" alt="Community: sustainability" /></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Joshua_Tanenbaum">Joshua Tanenbaum</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Simon_Fraser_University">Simon Fraser University, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Karen_Tanenbaum">Karen Tanenbaum</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Simon_Fraser_University">Simon Fraser University, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ron_Wakkary">Ron Wakkary</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Simon_Fraser_University">Simon Fraser University, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>A critical look at Steampunk through the lenses of design fiction, DIY, and appropriation.

This is due, in part, to search engines not providing feedback about how search behavior can be improved. Because feedback is an essential part of learning, we created the Search Dashboard, which provides an interface for reflection on personal search behavior. The Dashboard aggregates and presents an individual's search history and provides comparisons with that of archetypal expert profiles. Via a five-week study of 90 Search Dash-board users, we find that users are able to change aspects of their behavior to be more in line with that of the presented expert searchers. We also find that reflection can be beneficial, even without comparison, by changing participants' views about their own search skills, what is possible with search, and what aspects of their behavior may influence search success. Our findings demonstrate a new way for search engines to help users modify their search behavior for positive outcomes.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208311">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper175"><a class="title" href="Session143.html#paper175">Building the Trail Best Traveled: Effects of Domain Knowledge on Web Search Trailblazing</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Xiaojun_Yuan">Xiaojun Yuan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#State_University_of_New_York">State University of New York, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ryen_W_White">Ryen W White</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>User study on the impact of domain knowledge on Web search trailblazing (creating URL sequences to help searchers).

The trails generated from this process can be surfaced by search engines to help users engaged in these tasks. However, if search engines are going to have people generate trails they need to understand whether there is value in using domain experts for trailblazing (or whether novices are sufficient). In this paper, we describe the findings of a user study of trailblazing in the medical domain, comparing domain novices and experts. We observed differences in how people in each of the groups blazed trails and the value of the trails they generated; experts were more efficient and generated better-quality trails. Although there has been significant research on contrasting novice and expert search behaviors, to our knowledge there is no work (at least in the search domain) on establishing whether artifacts created by domain experts (trails in our case) are more valuable than those created by novices. The answer to this question is important for system designers who want to learn whether investing in domain expertise is worthwhile.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208312">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs127"><a class="title" href="Session143.html#cs127">A Survey on Web Use: How People Access, Consume, Keep, and Organize Web Content</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Seungyon_Claire_Lee">Seungyon Claire Lee</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Hewlett-Packard_Laboratories">Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eamonn_O'brien-Strain">Eamonn O'brien-Strain</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Hewlett-Packard_Laboratories">Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jerry_Liu">Jerry Liu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Hewlett-Packard_Laboratories">Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Qian_Lin">Qian Lin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Hewlett-Packard_Laboratories">Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This survey contributes to the design of cloud content repository by exploring the relationship between content characteristics (contacted by passive delivery vs. active discovery) and behavior (access, consume, keep, organize).</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> We present the results from a preliminary survey concerning the relationship between web content type (contacted by passive delivery or active discovery) and behavior (access, consume, keep, and organize).

Screen captures, video records, interviews, and verbal protocols are used to analyze common procedures in this type of visual data analysis, as well as how these procedures differ among these users. Our findings present a case where skilled users can approach a similar problem with diverging analysis strategies. In the group we observed, strategies fell within two broad categories: within-graph analysis, in which a user generates a few graph layouts and interacts heavily within them, and between-graph analysis, in which a user generates a series of graphs and switches between them in sequence. Differences in strategies lead to distinct interaction patterns, and are likely to be best supported by different interface designs. We characterize these observed strategies and discuss their implications for scientific visualization design and evaluation.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208291">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1255"><a class="title" href="Session167.html#paper1255">Understanding the Verbal Language and Structure of  End-User Descriptions of Data Visualizations</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ronald_Metoyer">Ronald Metoyer</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Oregon_State_University">Oregon State University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Bongshin_Lee">Bongshin Lee</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nathalie_Henry_Riche">Nathalie Henry Riche</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mary_Czerwinski">Mary Czerwinski</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Exploratory study of the verbal language employed by end users in describing data visualizations.

Analyses of such networks are often long and complex, and may require several sessions by multiple users. Therefore, it is often difficult for users to recall their own exploration history or share it with others. We introduce GraphTrail, an interactive visualization for analyzing networks through exploration of node and edge aggregates that captures users' interactions and integrates this history directly in the exploration workspace. To facilitate large network analysis, GraphTrail integrates aggregation with familiar charts, drag-and-drop interaction on a canvas, and a novel pivoting mechanism for transitioning between aggregates. Through a three-month field study with a team of archeologists and a qualitative lab study with ten users, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the benefits of integrated exploration history, including analysis comprehension, insight discovery, and exploration recall.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208293">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1229"><a class="title" href="Session167.html#paper1229">Trust Me, I'm Partially Right: Incremental Visualization Lets Analysts Explore Large Datasets Faster</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Danyel_Fisher">Danyel Fisher</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Igor_Popov">Igor Popov</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Southampton">University of Southampton, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Steven_Drucker">Steven Drucker</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#m.c._schraefel">m.c. schraefel</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Southampton">University of Southampton, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We contribute a methodology for simulating aggregate queries against large data back-ends for researchers to explore interactions; and observations of expert analysts interacting with approximate queries.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Queries over large scale (petabyte) data bases often mean waiting overnight for a result to come back.

We were struck by their playful use, especially given the very limited infrastructure and inexpensive devices that were available. Based on our findings, we discuss tensions between playfulness and utility, in particular relating to socio-economic benefits, and conclude that playfulness in these settings needs to be taken as seriously as in any other setting. Additionally, we formulated three challenges when designing for play in similar settings: (1) engage intimately with the materials of inexpensive ICT; (2) revisit design recommendations for playfulness to ensure that they can travel/translate into other cultures; and (3) alleviate existing tensions.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208348">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="to102"><a class="title" href="Session206.html#to102">Improving Performance, Perceived Usability, and Aesthetics with Culturally Adaptive User Interfaces</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">ToCHI</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Katharina_Reinecke">Katharina Reinecke</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Harvard_University">Harvard University, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Abraham_Bernstein">Abraham Bernstein</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Zurich">University of Zurich, </a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Beautiful?

In this paper, we argue that it is not feasible to design one interface that appeals to all users of an increasingly global audience. Instead, we propose to design culturally adaptive systems, which automatically generate personalized interfaces that correspond to cultural preferences. In an evaluation of one such system, we demonstrate that a majority of international participants preferred their personalized versions over a non-adapted interface of the same web site. Results show that users were 22% faster using the culturally adapted interface, needed less clicks, and made fewer errors, in line with subjective results demonstrating that they found the adapted version significantly easier to use. Our findings show that interfaces that adapt to cultural preferences can immensely increase the user experience.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs180"><a class="title" href="Session206.html#cs180">Digital Art and Interaction: Lessons in Collaboration</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="arts" src="images/arts.png" alt="Community: arts" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#David_England">David England</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#LJMU,_UK">LJMU, UK, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We present the evolution of Digital Art and HCI collaborations via three case studies.

However, dictation systems today follow a mentally disruptive speech interaction model: users must first formulate utterances and then produce them, as they would with a voice recorder. Because utterances do not get transcribed until users have finished speaking, the entire output appears and users must break their train of thought to verify and correct it. In this paper, we introduce Voice Typing, a new speech interaction model where users&#8217; utterances are transcribed as they produce them to enable real-time error identification. For fast correction, users leverage a marking menu using touch gestures. Voice Typing aspires to create an experience akin to having a secretary type for you, while you monitor and correct the text. In a user study where participants composed emails using both Voice Typing and traditional dictation, they not only reported lower cognitive demand for Voice Typing but also exhibited 29% relative reduction of user corrections. Overall, they also preferred Voice Typing.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208386">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper444"><a class="title" href="Session144.html#paper444">Legible, are you sure ?

Tools intended to improve color differentiability (recoloring tools) exist, but these all use abstract models of only a few types of congenital CVD; if the user&#65533;s color problems have a different cause, existing recolorers can perform poorly. We have developed a recoloring tool (SSMRecolor) based on the idea of situation-specific modeling &#65533; in which we build a performance-based model of a particular user in their specific environment, and use that model to drive the recoloring process. SSMRecolor covers a much wider range of CVDs, including acquired and situational deficiencies. We evaluated SSMRecolor and two existing tools in a controlled study of people&#65533;s color-matching performance in several environmental conditions. The study included participants with and without congenital CVD. Our results show both accuracy and response time in color-matching tasks were significantly better with SSMRecolor. This work demonstrates the value of a situation-specific approach to recoloring, and shows that this technique can substantially improve the usability of color displays for users of all types.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208388">ACM</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="noop"></td><td class="session" id="S176"><span class="type">Case Study &amp; Paper</span><a class="title" href="Session176.html">Mobile Computing and Interaction</a><span class="room">Room: 17AB</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="best"><img src="images/best.png"></div></td>

However, there are few systematic studies of enhancing spatial ability with mobile devices, and applications such as turn-by-turn navigation systems have even been associated with a decline in spatial skills. In this paper we present a study based on the 1971 Shepard-Metzler mental rotation test but performed on a mobile-phone handset and a tablet PC. Our study extends the original experiment with the incorporation of touch and tilt interaction techniques, in order to determine if these affect the use and acquisition of spatial skills. Results suggest that the task is performed faster, and with no significant difference in accuracy, when participants rely on mental abilities rather than interaction techniques to perform 3D rotations. We also find significant differences between tablet and phone handset platforms under interactive conditions. We conclude that applications on mobile devices could be designed to enhance rather than erode spatial skills, by supporting the use of imagination to align real and virtual content.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208284">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper995"><a class="title" href="Session176.html#paper995">The Normal Natural Troubles of Driving with GPS</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/best.png" class="best" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Barry_Brown">Barry Brown</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Mobile_Life_Centre">Mobile Life Centre, Sweden</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eric_Laurier">Eric Laurier</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#School_of_Geosciences,_University_of_Edinburgh">School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents a video analysis study of driving using GPS navigation systems in natural settings.

We raise implications for technologies to support DJs, while also shedding light on previous studies of music consumption and sharing in other settings.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208314">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1822"><a class="title" href="Session140.html#paper1822">Becoming-Sound: Affect and Assemblage in Improvisational Digital Music Making</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="arts" src="images/arts.png" alt="Community: arts" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Benjamin_Swift">Benjamin Swift</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Australian_National_University">Australian National University, Australia</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Affect and assemblage can help us understand the interaction between users and artefacts in interactive systems.

A grounded theory approach was taken to categorize 935 usability problems from the evaluation. Four major categories emerged: Physical presentation, Content, Information Architecture and Interactivity. Each major category had between 5 and 16 sub-categories. The categories and sub-categories were then analysed for whether they were found by users only, experts only or both users and experts.

This paper reports from a comparative study of the effect of task assignments and instruction types on the problems identified in remote asynchronous usability testing of a website for information retrieval, involving 53 prospective users. The results show that users solving predefined tasks identified significantly more usability problems with a significantly higher level of agreement than those working on their own authentic tasks. Moreover, users that were instructed by means of examples of usability problems identified significantly more usability problems than those who received a conceptual definition of usability problems. </span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208364">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper956"><a class="title" href="Session161.html#paper956">Analysis in Practical Usability Evaluation: A Survey Study</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Asbj&#248;rn_F&#248;lstad">Asbj&#248;rn F&#248;lstad</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#SINTEF">SINTEF, Norway</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Effie_Law">Effie Law</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Leicester">University of Leicester, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Kasper_Hornb&#230;k">Kasper Hornb&#230;k</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen, Denmark</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>A survey of 155 usability practitioners is presented, providing insight in current usability evaluation analysis practices and recommendations on how to align future research with practitioner needs for analysis support.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Analysis is a key part of conducting usability evaluations, yet rarely systematically studied.

User expectations and aspirations around their TV experiences are changing radically as the platform increasingly supplements broadcast network connectivity with IP connectivity.  Despite the relative youth of the platform, it is clear that Connected TV and its users support and seek user experiences which are quite distinctive from web browsing on personal computers, or earlier forms of interactive TV platforms.  We describe a number of the BBC&#8217;s recent research projects developing knowledge and tools to support future user experiences for TV, ranging from typography to alternative input interfaces.  In each case, we describe the motivation, the development approach and the empirical assessment of impact of the technology and experiences embodied by our prototypes.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1288"><a class="title" href="Session193.html#paper1288">Implicit Imitation in Social Tagging: Familiarity and Semantic Reconstruction</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Paul_Seitlinger">Paul Seitlinger</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Graz_University_of_Technology">Graz University of Technology, Austria</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tobias_Ley">Tobias Ley</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Tallinn_University">Tallinn University, Estonia</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents a multinomial model and experiment formalizing cognitive processes in social imitation in tagging.

It has been hypothesized to support collaborative sensemaking. In this paper, we examine some of the cognitive mechanisms assumed to underlie sensemaking, namely social imitation processes. We present a multinomial model that is applied to the generation of tags. In line with the semantic imitation model of Fu and colleagues, we assume that implicit processing can be understood as a semantic reconstruction of gist. Our model contrasts this process with a recall of tags from an explicit verbatim memory trace. We tested this model in an experimental study in which after the search task students had to generate tags themselves. We exposed their answers to a multinomial model derived from Fuzzy Trace Theory to obtain independent parameter estimates for the processes of explicit recall, semantic gist reconstruction and familiarity-based recall. As it turns out, a model that assumes all processes are at play explains the data well. Similar to results of our previous study, we find an influence of search intentions on the two processes. Our results have implications for interface and interaction design of social tagging systems, as well as for tag recommendation in these environments.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208287">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1110"><a class="title" href="Session193.html#paper1110">Annotating BI Visualization Dashboards: Needs &amp; Challenges</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Micheline_Elias">Micheline Elias</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Ecole_Centrale_Paris_"ECP"">Ecole Centrale Paris "ECP", France</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Anastasia_Bezerianos">Anastasia Bezerianos</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#INRIA">INRIA, France</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents the user-centered design of a visualization dashboard, which supports context aware and multi-chart annotations applied across visualizations and data dimension levels.

Thus in safety-critical environments, it is often considered safer to perform tasks sequentially. Here we explore how the cost of accessing information affects the way people choose to interleave. An empirical study based on a medical scenario was conducted. Participants had to program infusion pump devices using information from a prescription form. The physical and mental effort involved in accessing information was manipulated. This was achieved by varying the physical distance between the prescription form and the devices. We demonstrate that by increasing information access cost, individuals are less likely to omit a required task step. This is because they adopt a more memory-intensive strategy, which encourages interleaving at natural boundaries, i.e., after completing the programming of one of the pumps. Interleaving during programming can result in task steps being forgotten.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208289">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S177_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Brygg Ullmer, Louisiana State University, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs137"><a class="title" href="Session177.html#cs137">In Dialogue: Methodological Insights on Doing HCI Research in Rwanda</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Samantha_Merritt">Samantha Merritt</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Indiana_University">Indiana University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Abigail_Durrant">Abigail Durrant</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nottingham">University of Nottingham, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Stuart_Reeves">Stuart Reeves</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Nottingham">University of Nottingham, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#David_S_Kirk">David S Kirk</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Newcastle_University">Newcastle University, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Case study of research on memorialisation in post-genocide Rwanda, focussing on methodological challenges of working in a "transnational" context.

This NGO subsidizes health facilities by paying for medical services on the basis of claims submitted after the patient consultation, targeting treatment of 99,000 clients between 2006-2011. I successfully tested Claim Mobile in Summer 2008, processing 35 claims over two weeks, and then discontinued it six months later, when it became apparent that integration and scale-up of the technology would be problematic for the NGO. In addition, many issues we hoped to address through technology had been addressed through program management changes instead.  I find that a) the context motivating the technology changed over time, b) simpler solutions can be as effective as new technologies, and c) prioritizing the needs of the NGO required abandoning the deployment of Claim Mobile. Thus this paper presents the value of learning from failure in the process of designing for users in developing regions. </span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208319">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper905"><a class="title" href="Session177.html#paper905">mClerk: Enabling Mobile Crowdsourcing in Developing Regions</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Aakar_Gupta">Aakar Gupta</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#William_Thies">William Thies</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research_India">Microsoft Research India, India</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Edward_Cutrell">Edward Cutrell</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research_India">Microsoft Research India, India</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ravin_Balakrishnan">Ravin Balakrishnan</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Toronto">University of Toronto, Canada</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a new platform for crowdsourcing graphical tasks via SMS messages and studies its deployment in semi-urban India.

Via a 5-week deployment in semi-urban India, we demonstrate that mClerk is effective for digitizing local-language documents. Usage of mClerk spread virally from 10 users to 239 users, who digitized over 25,000 words during the study.

As a result, collaboration with the right individuals, teams and institutions is increasingly crucial for scientific progress. We propose &#8220;research networking systems&#8221; (RNS) as a new type  of system designed to help scientists identify and choose collaborators, and suggest a corresponding research agenda. The research agenda covers four areas: Foundations, Presentation, Architecture and Evaluation. Foundations includes project-, institution- and discipline-specific motivational factors; the role of social networks; and impression formation based on information beyond expertise and interests. Presentation addresses representing expertise in a comprehensive and up-to-date manner; the role of controlled vocabularies and folksonomies; the tension between seekers&#8217; need for comprehensive information and potential collaborators&#8217; desire to control how they are seen by others; and the need to support serendipitous discovery of collaborative opportunities. Architecture considers aggregation and synthesis of information from multiple  sources, social system interoperability,  and integration with the user&#8217;s primary work context. Lastly,  Evaluation focuses on assessment of collaboration decisions, measurement of user-specific costs and benefits, and how the large-scale impact of RNS could be evaluated with longitudinal and naturalistic methods.

Common approaches to authenticate a user on a mobile phone are based either on entering a PIN, a password, or drawing a pattern. However, these authentication methods are vulnerable to the shoulder surfing attack. The risk of this attack has increased since means for recording high-resolution videos are cheaply and widely accessible. If the attacker can videotape the authentication process, PINs, passwords, and patterns do not even provide the most basic level of security. In this project, we assessed the vulnerability of a magnetic gestural authentication method to the video-based shoulder surfing attack. We chose a scenario that is favourable to the attack-er. In a real world environment, we videotaped the interactions of four users performing magnetic signatures on a phone, in the presence of HD cameras from four different angles. We then recruited 22 participants and asked them to watch the videos and try to forge the signatures. The results revealed that with a certain threshold, i.e, th=1.67, none of the forging attacks was successful, whereas at this level all eligible login attempts were successfully recognized. The qualitative feedback also indicated that users found the magnetic gestural signature authentication method to be more secure than PIN-based and 2D signature methods.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208352">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs117"><a class="title" href="Session192.html#cs117">A Room with a View: Understanding Users' Stages in Picking a Hotel Online</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Short&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jens_Riegelsberger">Jens Riegelsberger</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Google_UK">Google UK, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michelle_Lee">Michelle Lee</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Google_Inc.,_New_York">Google Inc., New York, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Scott_Lederer">Scott Lederer</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Google_Inc.">Google Inc., USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Case study describing how a framework derived from lab usability study and literature guided development of Google Hotel Finder.

We ran a controlled experiment to explore how tablet orientation and hand position affect three novel techniques: bimanual taps, gestures and chords. Bimanual taps outperformed our one-handed control condition in both landscape and portrait orientations; bimanual chords and gestures in portrait mode only; and thumbs outperformed fingers, but were more tiring and less stable.

In a pair of studies we find that using two hands simultaneously is faster than using a single, dominant-handed marking menu by 10-15%. Alternating strokes between hands doubles the number of accessible menu items for the same number of strokes, and is similar in performance to using a one-handed marking menu. We also examine how stroke direction affects performance. When using thumbs on an iPod Touch, drawing strokes upwards and inwards is faster than other directions. For two-handed simultaneous menus, stroke pairs that are bilaterally symmetric or share the same direction are fastest.

We extend this prior work by analyzing the experience of 32 joggers to detail how specific design features facilitated, and hindered, an engaging and balanced exertion experience. With this knowledge, we derive four dimensions that describe a design space for balancing exertion experiences: Measurement, Adjustment, Presentation and Control. We also present six design tactics for creating balanced exertion experiences described by these dimensions.

Full-body motion-control games provide an opportunity for these adults to remain active and engaged; these games are not designed with age-related impairments in mind, which prevents the games from being leveraged to increase the activity levels of older adults. In this paper, we present two studies aimed at developing game design guidelines for full-body motion controls for older adults experiencing age-related changes and impairments. Our studies also demonstrate how full-body motion-control games can accommodate a variety of user abilities, have a positive effect on mood and, by extension, the emotional well-being of older adults. Based on our studies, we present seven guidelines for the design of full-body interaction in games. The guidelines are designed to foster safe physical activity among older adults, thereby increasing their quality of life.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208324">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs161"><a class="title" href="Session178.html#cs161">Wii as Entertainment and Socialisation Aids for Mental and Social Health of the Elderly</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Yin-Leng_Theng">Yin-Leng Theng</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nanyang_Technological_University">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Puay_Hoe_Chua">Puay Hoe Chua</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nanyang_Technological_University">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tan_Phat_Pham">Tan Phat Pham</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Wee_Kim_Wee_School_of_Communication_and_Information,_Nanyang_Technological_University">Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This study examines and discusses the effects of the Nintendo Wii games, examples of co-located games, as entertainment and socialization aids between the elderly and the youths.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> As the world population ages rapidly, it is likely that more elderly risks being detached from society. The possible isolation of many more elderly could lead to societal and mental health problems that could weigh down on public healthcare systems. Using surveys, focus groups, interviews and video analysis, our pilot study examines the effects of the Nintendo Wii games, examples of co-located games, between two generations (old and young), and the factors that could affect the adoption and enjoyment of computer-mediated games as entertainment and socialization aids between the elderly and the youths. This pilot study with 14 pairs of elderly-teenager participants shows that general attitude towards the other age group improves after a period of playing.

Recovery requires hundreds of daily repetitions of therapeutic exercises, often without therapist supervision. When performing therapy alone, people with limited motion often compensate for the lack of motion in one joint by moving another one. This compensation can impede the recovery progress and create new health problems. In this work we contribute (1) a methodology to reliably sense compensatory torso motion in the context of shoulder exercises done by persons with stroke and (2) the design and experimental evaluation of operant-conditioning-based strategies for games that aim to reduce compensatory torso motion. Our results show that these strategies significantly reduce compensatory motions compared to alternatives.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208354">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1546"><a class="title" href="Session185.html#paper1546">Of BATs and APEs: An Interactive Tabletop Game for Natural History Museums</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michael_S._Horn">Michael S.

We video recorded 30 families using the exhibit at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. We also observed an additional 50 social groups interacting with the exhibit without video recording. The goal of this research is to explore ways to develop "successful" interactive tabletop exhibits for museums. To determine criteria for success in this context, we borrow the concept of Active Prolonged Engagement (APE) from the science museum literature. Research on APE sets a high standard for visitor engagement and learning, and it offers a number of useful concepts and measures for research on interactive surfaces in the wild. In this paper we adapt and expand on these measures and apply them to our tabletop exhibit. Our results show that visitor groups collaborated effectively and engaged in focused, on-topic discussion for prolonged periods of time. To understand these results, we analyze visitor conversation at the exhibit. Our analysis suggests that social practices of game play contributed substantially to visitor collaboration and engagement with the exhibit.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208355">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1870"><a class="title" href="Session185.html#paper1870">Playable Character: Extending Digital Games into the Real World</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /><img class="sustainability" src="images/sustainability.png" alt="Community: sustainability" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jason_Linder">Jason Linder</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#California_College_of_the_Arts">California College of the Arts, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wendy_Ju">Wendy Ju</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#California_College_of_the_Arts">California College of the Arts, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This paper describes a series of research probe games developed to investigate how real-world activity could be incorporated into digital game systems.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> This paper describes a series of research probe games developed to investigate how real-world activity could be incorporated into digital game systems.

Engagement with BinCam is designed to fit into the existing structure of users' everyday life, with the intention that reflection on waste and recycling becomes a playful and shared group activity. Results of a user study reveal an increase in both users' awareness of, and reflection about, their waste management and their motivation to improve their waste-related skills. With BinCam, we also explore informational and normative social influences as a source of change (e.g., socially evoked feelings of 'guilt' for non-recycling or food disposal), which has to date been underexplored in persuasive HCI.

For instance, financial consequences, which have proved successful as motivations in the domestic environment, are not present in the workplace in the context of employees. We describe the outcome of a sequence of workshops that focussed on understanding employee perceptions of energy use in the workplace, with the locus of activity on energy intervention design. Using a grounded theory analysis, we produced a framework of key themes detailing user perceptions and energy intervention design considerations.

The first display set isolates and examines specific elements of an eco-feedback design space such as data and time granularity. Displays in the second set act as design probes to elicit reactions about competition, privacy, and integration into domestic space. The displays were evaluated via an online survey of 651 North American respondents and in-home, semi-structured interviews with 10 families (20 adults). Our findings are relevant not only to the design of future water eco-feedback systems but also for other types of consumption (e.g., electricity and gas).</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208397">ACM</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="noop"></td><td class="session" id="S214"><span class="type">Case Study, Paper &amp; ToCHI</span><a class="title" href="Session214.html">Time + Task:  Managing Work Life</a><span class="room">Room: 19AB</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="management" src="images/management.png" alt="Community: management" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div></td>

In particular, systems used in several recent experiments provided information about others' current activities so that their availability for conversation could be assessed, and interruptions could be timed strategically. One issue with these experimental systems, though, is that many do not notify the observed party that these observations are taking place. There is reason to believe that such notification could be valuable to users, and that it could alter observers' behavior. Moreover, factors such as the perceived urgency of the interruption could affect willingness to violate social norms in gathering information. We report on an experiment assessing the impact of perceived visibility and task urgency on awareness checking behavior. Results suggest that people check more often when they believe their partners do not know they are checking, and more often when the task is time-constrained than when it is not.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208308">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="to104"><a class="title" href="Session214.html#to104">MEASURING MULTITASKING BEHAVIOR WITH ACTIVITY-BASED METRICS</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">ToCHI</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Raquel_Benbunan-Fich">Raquel Benbunan-Fich</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Baruch_College,_City_University_of_New_York">Baruch College, City University of New York, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Rachel_Adler">Rachel Adler</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#The_Graduate_Center,_City_University_of_New_York">The Graduate Center, City University of New York, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tamilla_Mavlanova">Tamilla Mavlanova</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#The_Graduate_Center,_Baruch_College,_City_University_of_New_York">The Graduate Center, Baruch College, City University of New York, </a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Proposed multitasking metrics to establish a conceptual foundation for future multitasking studies.

Multitasking research is important in order to improve the design of systems and applications. Since people typically use computers to perform multiple tasks at the same time, insights into this type of behavior can help develop better systems and ideal types of computer environments for modern multitasking users. In this paper, we define multitasking based on the principles of task independence and performance concurrency and develop a set of metrics for computer-based multitasking. The theoretical foundation of this metric development effort stems from an application of key principles of Activity Theory and a systematic analysis of computer usage from the perspective of the user, the task and the technology. The proposed metrics, which range from a lean dichotomous variable to a richer measure based on switches, were validated with data from a sample of users who self-reported their activities during a computer usage session. This set of metrics can be used to establish a conceptual and methodological foundation for future multitasking studies.</span></div></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S174_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Meredith Ringel Morris, Microsoft Research, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1063"><a class="title" href="Session174.html#paper1063">Bridging Between Organizations and the Public: Volunteer Coordinators' Uneasy Relationship with Social Computing</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Amy_Voida">Amy Voida</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California,_Irvine">University of California, Irvine, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ellie_Harmon">Ellie Harmon</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California,_Irvine">University of California, Irvine, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ban_Al-Ani">Ban Al-Ani</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California,_Irvine">University of California, Irvine, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a study of the social computing use of volunteer coordinators.

The results of our research highlight the role service mediation plays in the use of services and service technologies in information-rich organizations.

This expertise means CLS's are well equipped to help technologists introduce child-facing interventions to the hospital. We conducted participatory design activities with 9 CLS's to develop two mobile systems to explore how CLS-child interactions are shaped by activities. We observed 18 child-CLS pairs using these systems in a hospital setting. By analyzing these encounters, we describe a continuum for classifying activities as either Co-Present or Collaborative.

These systems show physical activity information (e.g., step counts, energy expenditure, heart rate) which is sufficient for many self-knowledge needs, but information about the factors that affect physical activity may be needed for deeper self-reflection and increased self-knowledge. We explored the use of contextual information, such as events, places, and people, to support reflection on the factors that affect physical activity. We present three findings from our studies. First, users make associations between physical activity and contextual information that help them become aware of factors that affect their physical activity. Second, reflecting on physical activity and context can increase people&#8217;s awareness of opportunities for physical activity. Lastly, automated tracking of physical activity and contextual information benefits long-term reflection, but may have detrimental effects on immediate awareness.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper2003"><a class="title" href="Session170.html#paper2003">Adaptation as Design: Learning from an EMR Deployment Study</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sun_Young_Park">Sun Young Park</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California,_Irvine">University of California, Irvine, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Yunan_Chen">Yunan Chen</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California_Irvine">University of California Irvine, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>An observational study in an Emergency Department to examine clinicians' adaptation process after deploying an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> We conducted an observational study in an Emergency Department (ED) to examine the adaptation process after deploying an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system.

However, children's input and ideas require careful interpretation to reach viable designs and technical specifications, which poses a significant challenge to an adult design research team. In this paper we discuss our approach to managing the complexity of combining concepts and ideas that were generated through participatory design work with the practical, technical, ethical and theoretical constraints of developing a technologically enhanced learning environment for children with and without Autism Spectrum Conditions. We found that the nature of this design problem did not lend itself to be rationally reduced to produce a single solution, but required an understanding of interpretive and speculative approaches for us to be able to cope with the complexity of requirements. We describe a workshop in which members of the design team used such approaches to develop a design brief that is faithful to the children's input. By making this process transparent, we aim to contribute to the methodology of using such designerly approaches in combination with participatory and human-centred methods to develop interactive technology.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208399">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs132"><a class="title" href="Session194.html#cs132">Acquisition of Social Abilities through Musical Tangible User Interface: Children with Autism Spectrum Condition and the Reactable.</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="cci" src="images/cci.png" alt="Community: cci" /><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Lilia_Villafuerte">Lilia Villafuerte</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#MTG_-_UPF">MTG - UPF, Spain</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Milena_Markova">Milena Markova</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#MTG_-_UPF,_Barcelona">MTG - UPF, Barcelona, Spain</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sergi_Jorda">Sergi Jorda</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#MTG_-_UPF">MTG - UPF, Spain</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>The Reactable, a musical tangible user interface, is used with nine children with autism spectrum condition.

We see children as potential media trendsetters when it comes to video communication given their comfort with video and desire for rich social interactions. The results from this study were striking. Despite having frequent face-to-face interactions, the girls used our asynchronous video communication tool extensively to augment their existing relationships. Not only were they able to have rich conversations using asynchronous video, they also demonstrated a strong desire to share more than just a &#65533;talking head&#65533;.

The prediction lists generated by AccessRank are also shown to be more stable than other algorithms that have good predictive capability, which can be important for usability when items are presented in lists as users can rely on their spatial memory for target location.

The influence is stronger when people are required to make their second decision sometime later (22.4%) than immediately (14.1%). Moreover, people seem to be most likely to reverse their choices when facing a moderate, as opposed to large, number of opposing opinions.

In so doing, we illustrate the various levels at which agency can emerge in the context of intensive short-time prototyping sessions. In HCI, it is often assumed that the designer is the agent that acts intentionally in the design process. Contrary to this, recent notions of agency provide a way of analysing the performative role of design materials as intra-actions between components within a given phenomenon, rather than as meanings merely ascribed by actions of designers. The notion of agency puts focus on the emerging properties of materials and how they actively contribute to the way that design activity unfolds.  The analyses showed how interaction design is to a large extent driven by emergent characteristics of available materials.

In our case, we studied frontline firefighting by observing the existing practice, by developing empathy through participation and by introducing new technology as triggering artifacts. Applying grounded theory, we distilled our findings into pattern language describing core aspects of this practice and their interaction. In a workshop, we introduced the pattern language to developers who had no previous knowledge of this practice and, in follow-up interviews, confronted them with new technology proposals for firefighters. Our study shows that pattern language, while not to be confused with an immutable description of the status quo or a direct path from contextual analysis to design, supports a reflective discussion of novel technology and the fit with and potential impact on existing practice.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208418">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs128"><a class="title" href="Session191.html#cs128">VOLLEY: Design Framework for Collaborative Animation</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Short&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Cindy_Wong">Cindy Wong</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#New_York_University">New York University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Richard_Zaragoza">Richard Zaragoza</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research_FUSE_Labs">Microsoft Research FUSE Labs, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Case study describing design prototype for an online collaborative animation application.

The field has moved from command-line interfaces for time-sharing to gesture interfaces for brain wave sleep monitors on your telephone. As Hal Varian has pointed out, we are in one of those unusual combinatorial periods in history where technology offers us a rich set of recombinable components that have been perfected but not yet incorporated into the fabric of society. Furthermore, significant innovations can now be done by smaller teams at more rapid rates and lower cost than before. In fact, the technology has allowed the rise of a digital culture of DIY hobbyists, exemplified by the Maker, Instructables, and Quantified Self Movements, who emphasize exploring the newly possible and just-in-time self-education, There are at least two interesting implications for HCI, I think. First is that we are in a new golden age for HCI, like the heady days when the GUI was being invented. New I/O devices are needed, new major interaction paradigms are possible, and CHI conferences should become more interesting. Second, the state of current technology and the spirit of the Maker Movement suggest a means for making progress on one of HCI&#8217;s oldest structural problems: how to ground the field, accelerate its progress, and make it cumulative by fashioning theories and incorporating them into practice. It is this latter point on which I wish to dwell. In this talk, I will attempt to sketch out, in the spirit of the times, what an interaction science for HCI could look like, how it might be incorporated into practice, and how it might be taught. <br /> <br />BIO: Stuart Card works on the theory and design of human machine systems.

A prototype of an interface using tangential force input was implemented utilizing a force sensitive layer and an elastic layer and used for the user experiment. We investigated user controllability to reach and maintain target force levels and considered the effects of hand pose and direction of force input. Our results imply no significant difference in performance when applying force holding the device in one hand and in two hands. We also observed that users have more physical and perceived loads when applying tangential force in the left-right direction compared to the up-down direction. Based on the experimental results, we discuss considerations for user interface applications of tangential-force-based interface.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208727">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper538"><a class="title" href="Session197.html#paper538">PocketNavigator: Studying Tactile Navigation Systems In-Situ</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Martin_Pielot">Martin Pielot</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#OFFIS_Institute_for_Information_Technology,_Oldenburg,_Lower_Saxony,_Germany">OFFIS Institute for Information Technology, Oldenburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Benjamin_Poppinga">Benjamin Poppinga</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#OFFIS_Institute_for_Information_Technology">OFFIS Institute for Information Technology, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wilko_Heuten">Wilko Heuten</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#OFFIS_Institute_for_Information_Technology,_Oldenburg,_Lower_Saxony">OFFIS Institute for Information Technology, Oldenburg, Lower Saxony, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Susanne_Boll">Susanne Boll</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Oldenburg">University of Oldenburg, Germany</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Provides evidence from a study of a pedestrian navigation system published on the Android Market which shows that vibro-tactile navigation instructions can reduce the traveler's level of distraction.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> In this paper, we report about a large-scale in-situ study of tactile feedback for pedestrian navigation systems. Recent advances in smartphone technology have enabled a number of interaction techniques for smartphone that use tactile feedback to deliver navigation information. The aim is to enable eyes-free usage and avoid distracting the user from the environment. Field studies where participants had to fulfill given navigation tasks, have found these techniques to be efficient and beneficial in terms of distraction. But it is not yet clear whether these findings will replicate in in-situ usage. We, therefore, developed a Google Maps-like navigation application that incorporates interaction techniques proposed in previous work. The application was published for free on the Android Market and so people were able to use it as a navigation system in their everyday life. The data collected through anonymous monitoring suggests that tactile feedback is successfully adopted in one third of all trips and has positive effects on the user's level of distraction.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208728">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper941"><a class="title" href="Session197.html#paper941">Funneling and Saltation Effects for Tactile Interaction with Virtual Objects</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jaedong_Lee">Jaedong Lee</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Korea_University">Korea University, Korea</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Youngsun_Kim">Youngsun Kim</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Korea_University">Korea University, Korea</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Gerard_Kim">Gerard Kim</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Korea_University">Korea University, Korea</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We have newly verified for the first time that funneling and saltation, the two main perceptual tactile illusions exist also on virtual objects without any physical medium.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Funneling and saltation are two major illusory feedback techniques for vibration-based tactile feedback.

We developed a typing game that records how users touch on the standard Android keyboard to investigate users' typing behaviour. 47,770,625 keystrokes from 72,945 installations have been collected by publishing the game. By visualizing the touch distribution we identified a systematic skew and derived a function that compensates this skew by shifting touch events. By updating the game we conduct an experiment that investigates the effect of shifting touch events, changing the keys' labels, and visualizing the touched position. Results based on 6,603,659 keystrokes and 13,013 installations show that visualizing the touched positions using a simple dot decreases the error rate of the Android keyboard by 18.3% but also decreases the speed by 5.2% with no positive effect on learnability. The Android keyboard outperforms the control condition but the constructed shift function further improves the performance by 2.2% and decreases the error rate by 9.1%. We argue that the shift function can improve existing keyboards at no costs.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208658">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper814"><a class="title" href="Session195.html#paper814">Multidimensional Pareto Optimization of Touchscreen Keyboards for Speed, Familiarity and Improved Spell Checking</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mark_D_Dunlop">Mark D Dunlop</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Strathclyde">University of Strathclyde, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#John_Levine">John Levine</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Strathclyde">University of Strathclyde, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a new approach to keyboard layout optimization for faster text entry with better spell correction on touchscreen phones, while retaining familiarity with Qwerty. Includes designs and user test results.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> This paper presents a new optimization technique for keyboard layouts based on Pareto front optimization. We used this multifactorial technique to create two new touchscreen phone keyboard layouts based on three design metrics: minimizing finger travel distance in order to maximize text entry speed, a new metric to maximize the quality of spell correction by reducing tap ambiguity, and maximizing familiarity through a similarity function with the standard Qwerty layout. The paper describes the optimization process and resulting layouts for a standard trapezoid shaped keyboard and a more rectangular layout. Fitts' law modelling shows a predicted 11% improvement in entry speed without taking into account the significantly improved error correction potential and the subsequent effect on speed. In initial user tests typing speed dropped from approx. 21 wpm with Qwerty to 13 wpm (64%) on first use of our layout but recovered to 18 wpm (85%) within four short trial sessions, and was still improving. NASA TLX forms showed no significant difference on load between Qwerty and our new layout use in the fourth session. Together we believe this shows the new layouts are faster and can be quickly adopted by users.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208659">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1066"><a class="title" href="Session195.html#paper1066">Beyond QWERTY: Augmenting Touch Screen Keyboards with Multi-Touch Gestures for Non-Alphanumeric Input</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Leah_Findlater">Leah Findlater</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ben_Q_Lee">Ben Q Lee</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jacob_O_Wobbrock">Jacob O Wobbrock</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We introduce a bimanual, multi-touch gestural approach for non-alphanumeric text input on touch-screen keyboards.

To support this input, widely adopted commercial touch-screen interfaces require mode switches to alternate keyboard layouts for most punctuation and symbols. Our approach is to augment existing ten-finger QWERTY keyboards with multi-touch gestural input that can exist as a complement to the moded-keyboard approach. To inform our design, we conducted a study to elicit user-defined gestures from 20 participants. The final gesture set includes both multi-touch and single-touch gestures for commonly used non-alphanumeric text input. We implemented and conducted a preliminary evaluation of a touch-screen keyboard augmented with this technique. Findings show that using gestures for non-alphanumeric input is no slower than using keys, and that users strongly prefer gestures to a moded-keyboard interface.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208660">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper229"><a class="title" href="Session195.html#paper229">Touch Typing using Thumbs: Understanding the Effect of Mobility and Hand Posture</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Hugo_Nicolau">Hugo Nicolau</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#INESC-ID">INESC-ID, Portugal</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Joaquim_Jorge">Joaquim Jorge</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#INESC-ID">INESC-ID, Portugal</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents a user study of touch typing whilst walking and the effect of different hand postures and target size.

In this paper we analyze; firstly, the negative effect of walking on text-input performance, particularly the users' main difficulties and error patterns. We focused our research on thumb typing, since this is a commonly used technique to interact with touch interfaces. Secondly, we analyze how these effects can be compensated by two-hand interaction and increasing target size. We asked 22 participants to input text under three mobility conditions (seated, slow walking, and normal walking) and three hand conditions (one-hand/portrait, two-hand/portrait, and two-hand/landscape). Results show that independently of hand condition, mobility significantly decreased input quality, leading to specific error patterns. Moreover, it was shown that target size can compensate the negative effect of walking, while two-hand interaction does not provide additional stability or input accuracy. We finish with implications for future designs.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208661">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1147"><a class="title" href="Session195.html#paper1147">WalkType: Using Accelerometer Data to Accomodate Situational Impairments in Mobile Touch Screen Text Entry</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mayank_Goel">Mayank Goel</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Leah_Findlater">Leah Findlater</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Maryland">University of Maryland, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jacob_O_Wobbrock">Jacob O Wobbrock</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes an adaptive text entry system that leverages the mobile device's accelerometer to compensate for extraneous movement while walking.

A preliminary study revealed that users expect neither a global nor personal undo, but rather a regional undo. We propose and evaluate three automatic regional undo/redo techniques (clustering, workspace, field of view) designed for a large interactive whiteboard. The results of the evaluation showed that an undo technique based on users&#65533; field of view was most preferred, while the content-based clustering technique produced most errors.

Specifically, we have developed a set of user-independent classifiers for discriminating between deliberate, targeted mouse pointer movements and those movements that were affected by any extraneous factors. To develop and validate these classifiers, we developed logging software to unobtrusively record pointer trajectories as participants naturally interacted with their computers over the course of several weeks.  Each participant also performed a set of pointing tasks in a formal study set-up. For each movement, we computed a set of measures capturing nuances of the trajectory and the speed, acceleration, and jerk profiles. Treating the observations from the formal study as positive examples of deliberate, targeted movements and the in situ observations as unlabeled data with an unknown mix of deliberate and distracted interactions, we used a recent advance in machine learning to develop the classifiers. Our results show that, on four distinct metrics, the data collected in-situ and filtered with our classifiers closely matches the results obtained from the formal experiment. </span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208733">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper657"><a class="title" href="Session200.html#paper657">A General-Purpose Target-Aware Pointing Enhancement Using Pixel-Level Analysis of Graphical Interfaces</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Morgan_Dixon">Morgan Dixon</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#James_Fogarty">James Fogarty</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jacob_O_Wobbrock">Jacob O Wobbrock</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Washington">University of Washington, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We present a general-purpose implementation of a target aware pointing technique, functional across an entire desktop.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> We present a general-purpose implementation of a target aware pointing technique, functional across an entire desktop and independent of application implementations.

We discuss the most novel aspects of our implementation, including methods for interactive creation and correction of pixel-level prototypes of interface elements and methods for interactive annotation of how the cursor should select identified elements. We also report on limitations of the Bubble Cursor unearthed by examining our implementation in the complexity of real-world interfaces.

These examples couple the concrete functionality of code with rich contextual information about how the code works.

In short, a user's interaction with an example continues well after the code is pasted. This paper investigates whether treating examples as "first-class" objects in the code editor - rather than simply as strings of text - will allow programmers to use examples more effectively. We explore this through the creation and evaluation of Codelets. A Codelet is presented inline with the user's code, and consists of a block of example code and an interactive helper widget that assists the user in understanding and integrating the example. The Codelet persists throughout the example's lifecycle, remaining accessible even after configuration and integration is done. A comparative laboratory study with 20 participants found that programmers were able to complete tasks involving examples an average of 43% faster when using Codelets than when using a standard Web browser.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208664">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1713"><a class="title" href="Session189.html#paper1713">Evaluating Interactive Support for Secure Programming</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jing_Xie">Jing Xie</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_North_Carolina_at_Charlotte">University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Heather_Lipford">Heather Lipford</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_North_Carolina_at_Charlotte">University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Bei-Tseng_Chu">Bei-Tseng Chu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_North_Carolina_at_Charlotte">University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We developed an interactive tool that aids programmers in developing secure code and evaluated it through two comparison-based user studies.

Developers can easily test the generated code in Gesture Coder, refine it by adding more examples, and once they are satisfied with its performance integrate the code into their applications.

As the number of custom gestures grows it becomes increasingly difficult to 1) know if new gestures will conflict with existing gestures, and 2) know how to extend existing code to reliably recognize the complete gesture set. Proton is a novel framework that addresses both of these problems. Using Proton, the application developer declaratively specifies each gesture as a regular expression over a stream of touch events. Proton statically analyzes the set of gestures to report conflicts, and it automatically creates gesture recognizers for the entire set. To simplify the creation of complex multitouch gestures, Proton introduces gesture tablature, a graphical notation that concisely describes the sequencing of multiple interleaved touch actions over time. Proton contributes a graphical editor for authoring tablatures and automatically compiles tablatures into regular expressions. We present the architecture and implementation of Proton, along with three proof-of-concept applications. These applications demonstrate the expressiveness of the framework and show how Proton simplifies gesture definition and conflict resolution.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208694">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1130"><a class="title" href="Session199.html#paper1130">Bootstrapping Personal Gesture Shortcuts with the Wisdom of the Crowd and Handwriting Recognition</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Tom_Y_Ouyang">Tom Y Ouyang</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Yang_Li">Yang Li</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Google_Research">Google Research, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents a novel approach for bootstrapping personal gesture shortcuts, using a combination of crowdsourcing and handwriting recognition.

In this paper, we present Gesture Marks, a novel approach to touch-gesture interaction that allows a user to access applications and websites using gestures without having to define them first. It offers two distinctive solutions to address the problem of scalability. First, it leverages the "wisdom of the crowd", a continually evolving library of gesture shortcuts that are collected from the user population, to infer the meaning of gestures that a user never defined himself. Second, it combines an extensible template-based gesture recognizer with a specialized handwriting recognizer to even better address handwriting-based gestures, which are a common form of gesture shortcut. These approaches effectively bootstrap a user's personal gesture library, alleviating the need to define most gestures manually. Our work was motivated and validated via a series of user studies, and the findings from these studies add to the body of knowledge on gesture-based interaction.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208695">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs150"><a class="title" href="Session199.html#cs150">Self-Revealing Gestures: Teaching New Touch Interactions in Windows 8</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Kay_Hofmeester">Kay Hofmeester</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft">Microsoft, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jennifer_Wolfe">Jennifer Wolfe</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft">Microsoft, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Case study describing a design process for a teaching method for new touch gestures in Windows 8.

This paper presents an objective evaluation of several methods for the automated segmentation and classification of ES intervals from an eye movement recording, a technique that can be utilized to aid in the identification of usability problems during software usability testing. Techniques considered for automated segmentation of the eye movement recording into unique intervals include mouse/keyboard events and eye movement scanpaths. ES is identified by a number of eye movement metrics, including: fixation count, saccade amplitude, convex hull area, scanpath inflections, scanpath length, and scanpath duration. The ES intervals identified by each algorithm are compared to those produced by manual classification to verify the accuracy, precision, and performance of each algorithm. The results indicate that automated classification can be successfully employed to substantially reduce the amount of recorded data reviewed by HCI experts during usability testing, with relatively little loss in accuracy.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208703">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper784"><a class="title" href="Session216.html#paper784">An Evaluation of How Small User Interface Changes Can Improve Scientists' Analytic Strategies</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Radu_Jianu">Radu Jianu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Brown_University">Brown University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#David_H_Laidlaw">David H Laidlaw</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Brown_University">Brown University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We presented results from a quantitative user study showing that controlled changes in the interface of an analysis system can be employed to correct deficiencies in users' analytic behavior</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Subtle changes in analysis system interfaces can be used purposely to alter users' <br />analytic behaviors.

In this paper, we go beyond measurement of user behavior to  prediction of the resulting user experience from mouse patterns alone. Specifically, we identify mouse markers that can predict user frustration and reading struggles at reasonably high accuracy. We believe that mouse-based prediction of user experience is an important advance, and could potentially offer a scalable way to infer user experience on the web. In addition, we demonstrate that mouse tracking could be used for applications such as evaluating content layout and content noticeability; we apply this in particular to advertisements. More generally, it could  be used to infer user attention in complex webpages containing images, text and varied content,  including how attention patterns  vary  with page layout and user distraction.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208705">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1253"><a class="title" href="Session216.html#paper1253">Evaluating the Benefits of Real-time Feedback in Mobile Augmented Reality with Hand-held Devices</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Can_Liu">Can Liu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Stephane_Huot">Stephane Huot</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Univ_Paris-Sud_&amp;_CNRS">Univ Paris-Sud &amp; CNRS, France</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jonathan_Diehl">Jonathan Diehl</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University, Germany</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wendy_Mackay">Wendy Mackay</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#INRIA">INRIA, France</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Michel_Beaudouin-Lafon">Michel Beaudouin-Lafon</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Univ_Paris-Sud_&amp;_CNRS">Univ Paris-Sud &amp; CNRS, France</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Adding real-time feedback to a mobile Augmented Reality system to reflect the status of the physical objects being manipulated improves performance by reducing the division of attention.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Augmented Reality (AR) has been proved useful to guide operational tasks in professional domains  by reducing the shift of attention between instructions and physical objects.

A goal of the design is to extend the typical contexts of automotive user-interface design by (1) looking inward to the imagined &#8220;character&#8221; of the car and (2) looking outward to the larger social context that surrounds driving. We deploy storytelling and theatrical strategies as a way of moving our thinking outside the familiar constraints of automotive design. These methods help us to extend the concept of a lifelog to consider the &#8220;lives&#8221; of objects and the relationship between humans and non-humans as fruitful areas of design research.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="al126"><a class="title" href="Session4.html#al126">Crowdsourcing an Emotional Wardrobe</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">alt.chi</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Lucy_Hughes">Lucy Hughes</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_London">University College London, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Douglas_Atkinson">Douglas Atkinson</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Brunel">Brunel, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nadia_Berthouze">Nadia Berthouze</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_London">University College London, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sharon_Baurley">Sharon Baurley</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Brunel_University">Brunel University, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Investigating the possibility of designing a multi-modal language to enable the crowdsourcing of tactile perceptions of garments and the values that such a process would bring to our society.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Selecting clothing online requires decision-making about sensorial experiences, but online environments provide only limited sensorial information.

Modeled on physical life, it guides designers toward elegant social technologies. However, we argue that it breaks down over modern social network sites because social networks resist its physical metaphors. In this paper, we build theory relating social translucence to social network structure. To explore this idea, we built a tool called Link Different. Link Different addresses a structural awareness problem by letting users know how many of their Twitter followers already a saw link via someone else they follow. During two months on the web, nearly 150K people used the site a total of 1.3M times. Its widespread, viral use suggests that people want social translucence, but network structure gets in the way. We conclude the paper by illustrating new design problems that lie at the intersection of social translucence and other unexplored network structures.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208670">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1601"><a class="title" href="Session166.html#paper1601">A Longitudinal Study of Facebook, LinkedIn, &amp; Twitter Use</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="management" src="images/management.png" alt="Community: management" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Anne_Archambault">Anne Archambault</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Corporation">Microsoft Corporation, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jonathan_Grudin">Jonathan Grudin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Our longitudinal study of attitudes and behaviors around popular social networking sites in an enterprise context will contribute to understanding and potentially to design in this dynamic technology area.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> We conducted four annual comprehensive surveys of social networking at Microsoft between 2008 and 2011.

In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of how the news broke and spread on Twitter. We confirm the claim that Twitter broke the news first, and find evidence that Twitter had convinced a large number of its audience before mainstream media confirmed the news. We also discover that attention on Twitter was highly concentrated on a small number of "opinion leaders" and identify three groups of opinion leaders who played key roles in spreading the news: individuals affiliated with media played a large part in breaking the news, mass media brought the news to a wider audience and provided eager Twitter users with content on external sites, and celebrities helped to spread the news and stimulate conversation. Our findings suggest Twitter has great potential as a news medium.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208672">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper647"><a class="title" href="Session166.html#paper647">The Twitter Mute Button: A Web Filtering Challenge</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jennifer_Golbeck">Jennifer Golbeck</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Maryland,_College_Park">University of Maryland, College Park, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>We describe the challenge of selectively filtering Twitter content and illustrate this through a pilot study on filtering spoilers posted about televised events.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> The microblogging service Twitter has become an important, and sometimes primary, source of information for many users. As a forum for sharing news and discussing events, it can provide instant access to the latest updates, but this is not always welcome. In the case of television shows or live sporting events, for example, tweets about them may reveal spoilers to users in different time zones or who are delaying their viewing until later. More broadly, because Twitter is a broadcast medium, users may often want to temporarily or permanently hide content about a very specific given topic.  <br /> <br />In this paper, we describe the unique challenges to HCI, social computing, and computational linguistics  posed by the task of building an interface that blocks all tweets about a specific event or topic. We illustrate some of the challenges through a pilot experiment run for three major television events: the 2009 NFC Championship football game, the 2010 mid-season finale of the show Glee, and the 2010 season premiere of the show 24. While simple techniques achieve very high recall (&gt;98%), spoilers still make it through the filter and precision is extremely poor. We conclude with a description of challenges to the community in implementing this new and increasingly important feature. </span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208673">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs199"><a class="title" href="Session166.html#cs199">Nokia Internet Pulse: A Long Term Deployment and Iteration of a Twitter Visualization</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Joseph_'Jofish'_Kaye">Joseph 'Jofish' Kaye</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Research_Center">Nokia Research Center, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Anita_Lillie">Anita Lillie</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#LinkedIn">LinkedIn, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Deepak_Jagdish">Deepak Jagdish</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Research_Center">Nokia Research Center, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#James_Walkup">James Walkup</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Research_Center">Nokia Research Center, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Rita_Parada">Rita Parada</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Design">Nokia Design, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Koichi_Mori">Koichi Mori</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Nokia_Research_Center,_Palo_Alto">Nokia Research Center, Palo Alto, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This case study discusses the iterative design of a corporate system for visualizing tweets, showing sentiment and word frequency in an ambient display of current and recent public discussion.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Nokia Internet Pulse is a system for visualizing current discussion around a particular topic on Twitter. It consists of a time-series of stacked tag clouds consisting of the (interesting) words in tweets that match a topic.

In addition to showing topics of corporate interest ('Nokia', 'N9', etc.), the system is also useful for understanding buzz around individuals ('Rihanna'), conferences ('#chi2012'), topics ('rumor OR rumors'), Twitter-specific phenomena ('RT') and more.

We present an enquiry into design for dementia facilitated by a public art commission for an adult mental health unit in a hospital in the UK. The interactive art piece was informed by the notion of personhood in dementia that foregrounds the person's social being and interpersonal relationships as sites where self is maintained and constructed. How clients, clients' family members and staff used the piece is reported and insights related to the notions of home, intimacy, possessions and self are presented.

We report the findings of a laboratory experiment investigating the effects of increased interruption workload demand on older adults' computerised cognitive test performance. Related work has reported interruptions having a range of inhibitory and facilitatory effects on primary task performance. Cognitive ageing literature suggests that increased interruption workload demand should have greater detrimental effects on older adults' performance, when compared to younger adults. With 36 participants from 3 age groups (20-54, 55-69, 70+), we found divergent effects of increased interruption demand on two primary tasks. Results suggest that older and younger adults experience interruptions differently, but at no age is test performance compromised by demanding interruptions. This finding is reassuring with respect to the success of a self-administered computerised cognitive assessment test, and is likely to be useful for other applications used by older adults.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208656">ACM</a></div></div><div class="sessionDetails" id="S205_details"><div class="chair"><strong>Chair: </strong>Gary Hsieh, Michigan State University, USA</div><div class="submissionDetails" id="to114"><a class="title" href="Session205.html#to114">Mechanisms for Collaboration: A Design and Evaluation Framework for Multi-User Interfaces</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">ToCHI</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Nicola_Yuill">Nicola Yuill</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Sussex">University of Sussex, </a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Yvonne_Rogers">Yvonne Rogers</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_College_London,_London,_UK">University College London, London, UK, </a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Comprehensive conceptual framework for considering design and evaluation dimensions for how multi-user interfaces can best support collaboration in work and play across the range of users.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Multi-user interfaces are said to provide new opportunities for users to benefit from <br />&#8216;natural&#8217; interaction in supporting collaboration, compared to individual and non-colocated <br />technologies.

Twenty-three participants of diverse ethnicities, 11 women and 12 men (mean age, 21.7 years), were interviewed in same-sex discussion groups of four participants each. The interviews consisted of questions about the uses, benefits, and harms of social network sites and how people present themselves online. Qualitative analysis of the discussion group transcripts shows how young people explore their identities, cultivate and exploit social ties, experience interpersonal tensions, manage incompatible audiences, and respond to shifting affiliations and transitions. From this analysis, implications for social intervention and technical design are presented, focused on maintaining ties with pro-social family and friends and with maintaining separation between communication spheres of incompatible audiences.

However, searching, in-stalling and configuring new plug-ins requires complex overhead work that is only weakly addressed by existing support mechanisms. Recent research has highlighted the related practices of learning about new plug-ins and tailor-ing software tools as being highly cooperative, situated, socially embedded, and often connected to particular work situations. Based on an empirical study in small software enterprises, we develop an understanding of appropriation as a social and collaborative activity.

To investigate ways of encouraging team-like behavior among local and remote co-workers, we conducted a 2 (visual framing: decoration vs. no decoration) x 2 (verbal framing: interdependent vs. independent performance scoring) between-participants study (n=40). We hypothesized that verbally framing the situation as interdependent and visually framing the MRP system to create a sense of self-extension would enhance group cohesion between the local and the pilot.

The TeleHuman 3D videoconferencing system supports 360 degree motion parallax as the viewer moves around the cylinder and optionally, stereoscopic 3D display of the remote person. We evaluated the effect of perspective cues on the conveyance of nonverbal cues in two experiments using a one-way telecommunication version of the system. The first experiment focused on how well the system preserves gaze and hand pointing cues. The second experiment evaluated how well the system conveys 3D body postural information. We compared 3 perspective conditions: a conventional 2D view, a 2D view with 360 degree motion parallax, and a stereoscopic view with 360 degree motion parallax. Results suggest the combined presence of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues significantly improved the accuracy with which participants were able to assess gaze and hand pointing cues, and to instruct others on 3D body poses. The inclusion of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues also led to significant increases in the sense of social presence and telepresence reported by participants.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208640">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper634"><a class="title" href="Session207.html#paper634">MUSTARD: A Multi User See Through AR Display</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><img src="images/nominee.png" class="nominee" /><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Abhijit_Karnik">Abhijit Karnik</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Walterio_Mayol-Cuevas">Walterio Mayol-Cuevas</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sriram_Subramanian">Sriram Subramanian</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Bristol">University of Bristol, UK</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents a multiuser see-through display using LC panels.

An example is a personal telepresence robot, which acts as a physical proxy for a remote visitor, and uses cameras and microphones to capture its surroundings, which are transmitted back to the visitor. We propose the use of spherical displays to represent telepresent visitors at a destination. We suggest that the use of such 360 degree displays in a telepresence system has two key advantages: it is possible to understand the identity of the visitor from any viewpoint; and with suitable graphical representation, it is possible to tell where the visitor is looking from any viewpoint.

Because different communication infrastructures are available, situations of encounter are shown to be potentially seamful and to support multi-layered participation frames. Our observations show  a variety of encounter formats, among whom "timid" encounters are the most characteristic of the kind of sociality which may develop in urban public places turned into proximity-sensitive "hybrid ecologies"  The normative order which governs such encounters is marked by a tension between the minimality expected of encounters with strangers in urban spaces, and the concern for identification and focused interaction that derives from being engaged in proximal digital communication. These empirical observations and framework of analysis offer insights for the design and the understanding of proximity-based mobile technologies.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208675">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper781"><a class="title" href="Session208.html#paper781">Characterizing Web Use on Smartphones</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chad_C_Tossell">Chad C Tossell</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Rice_University">Rice University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Philip_Kortum">Philip Kortum</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Rice_University">Rice University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ahmad_Rahmati">Ahmad Rahmati</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Rice_University">Rice University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Clayton_Shepard">Clayton Shepard</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Rice_University">Rice University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Lin_Zhong">Lin Zhong</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Rice_University">Rice University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Establishes empirical patterns of behavior for web use on smartphones including visits to native applications, browser content and physical locations.

These data are used to describe smartphone usage and analyze revisitation patterns of web browsers, native applications, and physical locations where phones are used. Among our findings are that web page revisitation through browsers occurred very infrequently (approximately 25% of URLs are revisited by each user), bookmarks were used sparingly, physical traversing patterns mirrored virtual (internet) traversing patterns and users systematically differed in their web use.

We conducted an online survey to explore the user experience (UX) of early stage mobile AR applications available in the market in spring 2011, covering both location-based AR browsers and image recognition AR applications for object-based interaction. We identify various types of experiences such applications have evoked by qualitatively analyzing 84 users&#8217; narratives of their most satisfying and unsatisfying experiences. The results highlight, for example, experiences of awareness of surroundings, empowerment, positive surprise, amazement and fascination from the novelty value, as well as some examples of immersion and social connectivity. The analysis indicates that the applications have not yet reached their potential in evoking a multifaceted user experience that is characteristic especially to AR.

Gaze-based graphical passwords are a particularly promising means for shoulder-surfing-resistant authentication, but selecting secure passwords remains challenging. In this paper, we present a novel gaze-based authentication scheme that makes use of cued-recall graphical passwords on a single image. In order to increase password security, our approach uses a computational model of visual attention to mask those areas of the image that are most likely to attract visual attention. We create a realistic threat model for attacks that may occur in public settings, such as filming the user's interaction while drawing money from an ATM. Based on a 12-participant user study, we show that our approach is significantly more secure than a standard image-based authentication and gaze-based 4-digit PIN entry.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208712">ACM</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="noop"></td><td class="session" id="S210"><span class="type">Case Study &amp; Paper</span><a class="title" href="Session210.html">Right Where I Am:  UX in Complex Environments</a><span class="room">Room: 18AB</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div></td>

Panoramas are typically visualized as rectangular photographs, but this does not provide clear cues for physical directions in the environment.

Our results show that good readability of the panorama is most important and that a clear representation of the spatial mapping plays a secondary role.

This dilemma has inspired researchers to use virtual environments (VEs) to acquire control while offering the user a rich contextual experience. Although promising, these studies are mainly concerned with usability and the technical realization of their setup. Furthermore, previous setups leave room for improvement regarding the user's immersive experience. This paper contributes to this line of research by presenting a UX case study on mobile advertising with a novel CAVE-smartphone interface. We conducted two experiments in which we evaluated the intrusiveness of a mobile location-based advertising app in a virtual supermarket. The results confirm our hypothesis that context-congruent ads lessen the experienced intrusiveness thereby demonstrating that our setup is capable of generating preliminary meaningful results with regards to UX. Furthermore, we share insights in conducting these studies.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208646">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs113"><a class="title" href="Session210.html#cs113">Case Study: Longitudinal Comparative Analysis for Analyzing User Behavior</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jhilmil_Jain">Jhilmil Jain</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Google">Google, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Susan_Boyce">Susan Boyce</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Microsoft">Microsoft, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Describes a four-step process for eliciting and analyzing user behavior with products over an extended period of time</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> In this case study we describe a four-step process for eliciting and analyzing user behavior with products over an extended period of time.

Video feeds are simulated using a game engine.  While locating targets within a 3D terrain using a 2D 360-degree interface, participants indicated perceived egocentric directions to targets and later placed targets on an overhead view of the terrain.  Interfaces were compared based on target finding and map placement performance.  Results suggest 1) non-seamless interfaces with visual boundaries facilitate spatial understanding, 2) correct perception of self-to-object relationships is not correlated with understanding object-to-object relationships within the environment, and 3) increased video game experience corresponds with better spatial understanding of an environment observed in 360-degrees.

However, there has not been research examining the relationship between participants' protective behavior toward human/AI team-mates and their beliefs about their behavior. A study was conducted in which 32 participants played two sessions of a cooperative game, once with a "presumed" human and once with an AI team-mate; players could "draw fire" from a common enemy by "yelling" at it. Overwhelmingly, players claimed they "drew fire" on behalf of the presumed human more than for the AI team-mate; logged data indicates the opposite.  The main contribution of this paper is to provide evidence of the mismatch in player beliefs about their actions and actual behavior with humans or agents and provides possible explanations for the differences.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208680">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs144"><a class="title" href="Session211.html#cs144">The Reality of Fantasy: Uncovering Information-Seeking Behaviors and Needs in Online Fantasy Sports</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sandra_Hirsh">Sandra Hirsh</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#San_Jose_State_University">San Jose State University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Christine_Anderson">Christine Anderson</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Sportvision">Sportvision, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Matthew_Caselli">Matthew Caselli</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#San_Jose_State_University">San Jose State University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents a first study of information-seeking behaviors and needs for online fantasy sports players across different sports, and identifies tools they might want and need for better performances and experiences.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Online fantasy sports are rapidly growing in popularity.

We prepared an on-line experimental system in which a participant and an agent play a repeated penny-matching game with a bonus round. We then conducted experiments in which different opponent agents (human or robot) change their strategy during the game.

Challenges assumptions about users having unlimited Internet connections and suggests design implications for those on capped bandwidth plans.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Bandwidth caps, a limit on the amount of data users can upload and download in a month, are common globally for both home and mobile Internet access. With caps, each bit of data consumed comes at a cost against a monthly quota or a running tab. Yet, relatively little work has considered the implications of this usage-based pricing model on the user experience. In this paper, we present results from a qualitative study of households living with bandwidth caps. Our findings suggest home users grapple with three uncertainties regarding their bandwidth usage: invisible balances, mysterious processes, and multiple users. We discuss how these uncertainties impact their usage and describe the potential for better tools to help monitor and manage data caps. We conclude that as a community we need to cater for users under Internet cost constraints.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208714">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1881"><a class="title" href="Session212.html#paper1881">Age Differences in Exploratory Learning from a Health Information Website</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Jessie_Chin">Jessie Chin</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana_Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wai-Tat_Fu">Wai-Tat Fu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>An empirical study examined age differences in learning health information with recommended links having implications on designs of health information interfaces that facilitate search and learning for different age groups.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> An empirical study was conducted to investigate how older and younger users learned by performing exploratory search of health information using an interface that recommended relevant links based on browsing histories.

Participants had teens in their homes and devices like computers and cell phones played a powerful and preeminent role in family life. Our results show that socioeconomic differences both reflect and reinforce technology use at home. Specifically, low socioeconomic status families share devices more often and low socioeconomic status teens have more responsibility and independence in their technology use. We argue that that as low socioeconomic status families become the majority demographic, the CHI community needs to better understand how to design for these groups.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208716">ACM</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="noop"></td><td class="session" id="S213"><span class="type">Paper</span><a class="title" href="Session213.html">Health and Children</a><span class="room">Room: 18CD</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="cci" src="images/cci.png" alt="Community: cci" /><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div></td>

A clear understanding of children&#65533;s headache characteristics is crucial for delivering appropriate treatment. However, current data collection methods were designed for adults often resulting in insufficient information. In this paper we present a novel method to help children communicate with health care providers and researchers about their headaches. It augments an existing child-centric method called Draw-and-Tell Conversation, which has already been shown to provide more actionable information from children than standard data collection methods.  It does so by enabling children to draw their symptoms on a zoomable drawing application, giving them the ability to provide more details and context than on paper. We present a study conducted with nineteen children aged 7 to 12 suggesting that children provided more information about their headaches when using the zoomable drawing application than when drawing on paper. This study provides a rare example of a mobile device used to enhance face-to-face interactions and contributes evidence of a specific benefit of zoomable user interfaces.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208651">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1252"><a class="title" href="Session213.html#paper1252">Design of an Exergaming Station for Children with Cerebral Palsy</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="games" src="images/games.png" alt="Community: games" /><img class="health" src="images/health.png" alt="Community: health" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Hamilton_A._Hernandez">Hamilton A.

The eLabBench supports the organization of personal information, capture of experimental work for later access, and the use of a variety of computational resources directly at the lab bench. We deployed the eLabBench in a biology laboratory for 16 weeks, and invited seven molecular biologists to run experiments on it. We report on how they used the bench and how it fitted within their larger experimental process. The main impact of the eLabBench lies in the changes it sparked off in preparing, running, and documenting lab experiments. By supporting computation at the bench and management of physical objects in the office, the eLabBench blurred the separation between office and laboratory work. Based on our observations, we discuss how interactive systems for laboratories such as the eLabBench can support a more exploratory or design-oriented way of "doing" science.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208718">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1153"><a class="title" href="Session215.html#paper1153">How Students Find, Evaluate and Utilize Peer-Collected Annotated Multimedia Data in Science Inquiry with Zydeco</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /></div><div class="communities featured"><img class="cci" src="images/cci.png" alt="Community: cci" /></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Alex_Kuhn">Alex Kuhn</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Brenna_McNally">Brenna McNally</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Shannon_Schmoll">Shannon Schmoll</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Clara_Cahill">Clara Cahill</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wan-Tzu_Lo">Wan-Tzu Lo</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chris_Quintana">Chris Quintana</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Ibrahim_Delen">Ibrahim Delen</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Presents a study on how students (ages 11-13) search for, evaluate, and use annotated student-collected data.

We ran a classroom study with 54 students (ages 11-13) investigating how students searched for, evaluated, and used annotated data to construct a scientific explanation.

When societies experience disruption as caused by  natural disasters, various official government agencies, relief organizations, and emergent citizen groups aid in the recovery effort&#8212;where normal societal function resumes. In war environments however, societal trust can be affected and people may develop distrust of the institutions and associated individuals that provide and repair infrastructure. We show how citizens used ICTs to repair infrastructure during ongoing disruption caused by conflict by creating new, reliable technology-mediated social arrangements that enabled people to maintain daily routines for travel, education and obtaining information.

The need for interoperability in emergency communication systems has hastened the development of interoperable communication technology that is an enabling technology to automatically identify environmental variables including appropriate radio frequencies and to connect different networks used by different organizations.  Even though the technology has been researched from many perspectives and has shown the possibility to connect different organizations, there still remain many issues in terms of socio-cognitive aspects.  Thus, this study examines the socio-cognitive dimensions of interoperability, which equal the technical dimensions of the problem in importance.  The existential-phenomenological study reported here used semi-structured interviews to reconceptualize interoperability in the public safety communication domain.  Based on 11 interviews with public safety workers, five important factors were identified that have a major impact on the effectiveness of interoperable groups: information sharedness, operational awareness, communication readiness, adaptiveness, and coupledness.  Based on these main concepts, high-level suggestions are provided to guide the design of a new public safety communication system. The results can be directly applied to identify the requirements of communication systems and can be extended to design collaboration systems under stressful environments.</span></div></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs149"><a class="title" href="Session201.html#cs149">Disaster Symbolism and Social Media</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"><img class="design" src="images/design.png" alt="Community: design" /><img class="user experience" src="images/user_experience.png" alt="Community: user experience" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Hiroko_Wilensky">Hiroko Wilensky</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#University_of_California,_Irvine">University of California, Irvine, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This paper addresses that symbols emerged in social media can be a valuable medium for people in crisis to find emotional support and to reconstruct value system and identity.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> Research on the use of social media during disaster events has gained attention in recent years.

We address a <br />  challenge to many existing studies of motivation in online contexts: <br />  they are based on survey self-reports, which are <br />  susceptible to effects such as social desirability bias. In <br />  addition we investigate a second challenge to the extant research on <br />  motivation in the context of MTurk: a failure to examine potential <br />  differences between MTurk workers (Turkers) from different parts <br />  of the world, especially those from the US and India, MTurk's two <br />  largest worker groups. Using a survey technique called the list  <br />  experiment, we observe distinct profiles of motivation and patterns of  <br />  social desirability effects among Turkers in the US and India.  <br />  Among US Turkers, we find that social desirability <br />  encourages over-reporting of each of four motivating <br />  factors we examined. The over-reporting was particularly large in <br />  the case of money as a motivator. In contrast, among Turkers in <br />  India we find a more complex pattern of social desirability effects, <br />  with workers under-reporting ``killing time'' and ``fun'' as <br />  motivations, and drastically over-reporting ``sense of purpose.'' <br />  We conclude by discussing these results and proposing implications <br />  for future research and design.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208699">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1095"><a class="title" href="Session202.html#paper1095">Deploying MonoTrans Widgets in the Wild</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Note</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Chang_Hu">Chang Hu</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Computer_Science_Department,_University_of_Maryland">Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Philip_Resnik">Philip Resnik</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Computer_Science_Department,_University_of_Maryland">Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Yakov_Kronrod">Yakov Kronrod</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Department_of_Linguistics,_University_of_Maryland">Department of Linguistics, University of Maryland, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Benjamin_B_Bederson">Benjamin B Bederson</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Computer_Science_Department,_University_of_Maryland">Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>Our first attempt to deploy a crowd-sourced monolingual translation system to the wild finds interesting lesson dealing with crowds with different sizes simultaneously.</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> In this paper, we report our experience deploying the MonoTrans Widgets system in a public setting.

We found that not all types of voting are the same: negative voting of users was the strongest factor explaining deletion of a Write-up.

Through a study of 614 staff members at a large university, we show how social capital, network characteristics, and use of Facebook are related to how useful individuals find Facebook to be for informational purposes and their propensity to seek different types of information on the site. We find that bridging social capital and engagement with one&#8217;s network through directed communication behaviors are important predictors of these dimensions of information seeking; furthermore, a number of demographic and usage behavior differences exist between those who choose to engage in information-seeking behaviors on Facebook and those who do not. Finally, when predicting information-seeking behaviors, we identify a significant interaction between users&#8217; perceptions of Facebook as appropriate for purposes beyond the purely social and their engagement with their network.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208739">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper1859"><a class="title" href="Session203.html#paper1859">WebCrystal: Understanding and Reusing Examples in Web Authoring</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"><img class="engineering" src="images/engineering.png" alt="Community: engineering" /></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Kerry_S._Chang">Kerry S.

However, without actually understanding how an example is constructed, people often have trouble extracting the elements they want and incorporating them into their own design. This paper introduces WebCrystal, a web development tool that helps users understand how a web page is built. WebCrystal con-tributes novel interaction techniques that let the user quickly access HTML and CSS information by selecting questions regarding how a selected element is designed. It pro-vides answers using a textual description and a customized code snippet that can be copied-and-pasted to recreate the desired properties. WebCrystal also supports combining the styles and structures from multiple elements into the generated code snippet, and provides visualizations on the web page itself to explain layout relationships. Our user study shows that WebCrystal helped both novice and experienced developers complete more tasks successfully using significantly less time.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208740">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="paper990"><a class="title" href="Session203.html#paper990">Understanding Mobile Q&amp;A Usage: An Exploratory Study</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Paper</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Uichin_Lee">Uichin Lee</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#KAIST">KAIST, Korea, Republic of</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Hyanghong_Kang">Hyanghong Kang</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#KAIST">KAIST, Korea, Republic of</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Eunhee_Yi">Eunhee Yi</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#KAIST">KAIST, Korea, Republic of</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mun_Y._Yi">Mun Y.

These mobile Q&amp;A services are very different from traditional Q&amp;A sites in that questions/answers are short in length and are exchanged via mobile devices (e.g., SMS or mobile Internet). While traditional Q&amp;A sites have been well investigated, so far little is known about the mobile Q&amp;A usage. To understand mobile Q&amp;A usage, we analyzed 2.4 million question/answer pairs spanning a 14 month period from Naver Mobile Q&amp;A and performed a complementary survey study of 555 active mobile Q&amp;A users. We find that mobile Q&amp;A is deeply wired into users' everyday life activities--its usage is largely dependent on users' spatial, temporal, and social contexts; the key factors of mobile Q&amp;A usage are accessibility/convenience of mobile Q&amp;A, promptness of receiving answers, and users' satisficing behavior of information seeking (i.e., minimizing efforts and settling with good enough information). We also observe that users tend to seek more factual information attributed to everyday life activities than they do on traditional Q&amp;A sites and that they exhibit unique interaction patterns such as repeating and refining questions as coping strategies in seeking information needs. Our main findings reported in the paper have significant implications on the design of mobile Q&amp;A systems.</span></div><a class="acm" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208741">ACM</a></div><div class="submissionDetails" id="cs138"><a class="title" href="Session203.html#cs138">Using Physical-Social Interactions to Support Information Re-finding</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="type">Long&nbsp;Case&nbsp;Study</span><div class="communities core"></div><div class="communities featured"></div><div class="authors"><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Blake_Sawyer">Blake Sawyer</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University">Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Francis_Quek">Francis Quek</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University_(Virginia_Tech)">Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Wai_Choong_Wong">Wai Choong Wong</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_University_of_Singapore">National University of Singapore, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Mehul_Motani">Mehul Motani</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#National_University_of_Singapore">National University of Singapore, Singapore</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Sharon_Lynn_Chu_Yew_Yee">Sharon Lynn Chu Yew Yee</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University">Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA</a></div><div class="author"><a class="name" href="authors.html#Manuel_Perez-Quinones">Manuel Perez-Quinones</a> <span> - </span><a class="affiliation" href="affiliations.html#Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University">Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA</a></div></div><div class="cAndB"><strong>Contribution &amp Benefit: </strong>This case study presents a system that tracks when information is used during physical-social interactions and automatically tags information with people and groups of people (i.e., social orbits).</div><div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract &raquo;</strong><span class="text"> A dominant way in which we organize our world is through social interactions. Much research has made use of social context as a way to support information storage and re-finding. However, they tend to focus only on the virtual side of sociality, and downplay the role of physicality in social interaction. In our research, we investigate how a person's physical-social interactions, in the form of co-presence, can be employed to support digital information management. We designed and implemented a system based on this concept and evaluated it in three two-month long case studies. Our system associates digital information used in social situations with co-present individuals through the use of automatic or manual tagging.  Our findings showed that although the three participants varied greatly in their information filing and information use strategies, they all accessed digital information using people or groups of people, thereby supporting our initial premise.  However, we found that the need to use digital information during social interactions arises only when there is a shared focus in the form of, for example, a large display, or when there is a social purpose for the information, for instance to share it with other meeting members at a later time. Our observations suggest the need for further research and innovation in technology affordances for real-time information use in physical-social interactions.</span></div></div></div></td></tr></table>
