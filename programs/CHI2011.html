<h2>Best of CHI 2011 Award Winners</h2>

<p>ACM SIGCHI – the official sponsor of 2011 ACM conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems <a href="http://chi2011.org">CHI 2011 </a>, the premiere international conference for Human-Computer Interaction to be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada, 9-12 May 2011 – today announced the winners of the annual "Best of CHI" awards. The program recognizes outstanding work in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) by honoring exceptional technical papers, notes and case studies submitted to CHI. </p>
<p>The review committees for these formally reviewed submission categories nominated the top 5% of submissions to receive “Honorable Mention” awards.  A separate Best of CHI Committee then reviewed the “Honorable Mention” awardees and selected a subset that is no greater than 1% of all submissions to receive a “Best” designation. </p>

<p>For CHI 2011, the Papers and Notes committee awarded "Honorable Mention" to 77 out of the 1540 submissions.   Of these top 5% “Honorable Mention” recipients, the Best of CHI Committee awarded “Best” designations to 15 Papers and Notes. </p>

<p>This year, in addition to awards in the CHI Papers and Notes venues, awards were also designated for exceptional Case Studies that explore the application of HCI principles on real world experience.  The Case Studies committee awarded "Honorable Mention" to 4 of the 72 submissions, one of which also received a "Best" designation. </p>
